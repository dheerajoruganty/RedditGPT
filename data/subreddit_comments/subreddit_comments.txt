I don't think it'll get much value in valorant. ttk is high in ow2, thats why you have ample time to pull your teammate back once they're low or getting thrown off the map. the only use it might have in valo is that if you're stuck across an op.
yeah the stuns are problematic to hit, plus the initial stun makes it harder to stun close angles without hitting yourself
Answer this comment if you need a code, I'll answer in 10 hours if I got them or not, good luck all o7
These are all good tips except the first one which YES it’s good but I think it is bad to stress it that hard and say objectively that’s how it should be done every time. There are lots of situational moments where it is untrue and saying it your way makes it seem very one dimensional and will make people not use their brains situationally
Usually small streamers is more fun tho, they joke around a lot
well what’s ur rank
Report and move on
honestly prime, oni and ion buff my aim while rgx makes me not hit a single shot 😭
Olavo??

What kind of Fortnite is this? mine don't look like that. anyone have a clue??
I actually would be on today but you’re welcome.
You kid need to go to sleep now...
You have school tomorrow..
yes
I feel like this is just the state of gaming now imo
It does, idk if u know who LotharHS is, hes a vct analysist and vct caster and he streams on twitch. He knows ppl at riot and he always reports ppl in his game this way and he knows devs who told him how riot support works.

Sideshow watching KC or TenZ "IT'S HIS WORLD, AND WE'RE JUST LIVING IN IT"
To immy
Too slow means up it, who cares what other people say if it works it worms
Are you sure? Cause I promise if you use a hyper x pair of proper headphones rather than a cheap pair it makes a huge difference- if you are really competitive and want to rank up/ take rank seriously etc. I feel like I'm basically trolling if I wear my cheap earphones, miss out on too many kills maybe wins because I do wear them when I'm smurfing with my friends that are lower ranked.
Especially when it’s a whole 40 dollars just completely burned, skins just hold no worth
as a coach your sole purpose is to make the players you coach better. You think Andy Reid was a Mahomes level qb before Mahomes ? No. He’s a coach and good at coaching. Whether Hooj is radiant or silver doesn’t matter because he has good insight and is a GOOD COACH.
Zapper_345 here, expert at Nerfology, and i say we should nerf Chamber so his op only has one shot (Its too op rn), make every shot of his gun cost 300 creds (too low cost rn) and make his sentry thing only detect people that walk on it, and have it be disabled if chamber goes 5 meters away from it (its so op at watching flank).
As an ascendant player (peak immo), I hate this rank with a passion, immortal is way more playable
Been doing that in city. Mostly just need metal and gear parts and I should be good. It also doesn't help that anytime I do a mission where I gotta defend something I use so much metal and brick if I'm solo.
Literally did this last game I played. Jett was running his mouth that I didn't have a kill 9 rounds in and to stop IGLing because my calls were worthless (when we were down 4-5...)

Muted him. Won. Finished somewhere in the middle of the scoreboard. Played smokes. And halfway through the game my entire team told him to shut up and/or muted him too. Not always do the toxic ones have teammates in the lobby

Either way, your mental health isn't worth any rank, any rr, in any game
U can look at it as a 100% off discount..

I haven’t seen a afk endurance in a public ssd in like 5 years. Everybody that I know plays afk endurance solo including me for 2 reason. 

1. They didn’t spend 50k mats on the endurance fuck them
2. I’m usually doing afk Twine and u need to stand in a afk spot or ur fucked. Same thing with Canny I believe for later waves but plankerton and stonewood should both be fine.
How do you get it?? 😭😭 It's not appearing for me
I just lock breach, and knock people off B site with my ult while they plant.
Save the world isn’t on switch
Hell yeh, i wouldnt say fond but bad things i had homebases wiped by epic games 🤣🤣 but compensated with Llamas. 

Its been an experience mate i have to be honest working from 500 wood/metal/brick to now 5000 of each.

Hero loadouts was never a thing so there has been alot of changes over the years an i must say ive seen them all 🤣
I don’t really value small talk with random people playing valorant. While ive made a couple great friends through it 90% of people are just annoying/unfunny and don’t shut up.

That combined an annoying amount of people who will harass you for being a girl makes me not talk until i have to give an urgent comm.
Lars isn't returning because it's considered pay-to-win by their standards, so your only chance of getting it is paying over a hundred if not hundreds of dollars to someone that still has a code.

The Ned pack *may* return at some point but no one knows. However, if you have an Xbox or a Microsoft account (linked to your Epic) and use xcloud, as well as a VPN (I use the free VPN . lat app for Android), you can get the Ned pack for $10-$15 on Gameflip and use the VPN to redeem (they're cheap because they're from foreign regions). If you need more info/help in doing so, you can pm me because I do this with every pack I want.
What doesn’t she fill for a setinel? And wouldn’t her not needing a buff be counter productive for her to be utilized better as a setinel despite her winrate?

Few points

1. Jett's smokes used to last 8secs and she could carry 3 smokes at once. It was nerfed. 

2. She used to have double updraft.

3. Right clicking on ult used to return the knives back when you get a frag.

4. Insta dash which was later nerfed. 


She used to be crack. She was nerfed like hell but is still the most popular duelist after raze. These flaws are necessary. Or else she breaks the game.



As for how to get better with jett? Idk I don't play jett.
You’ll probably get there sooner or later. My stats are worse and im bronze.
At this point I’d rather want them to not disable ranked queue and keep these „patches“ to themselves
Nah man shit talking the other team is peak
I've gotten the rgx blade like 5 times already but I'm looking for the butterfly rgx
ty for advice i really appriciate the positivity<3
no voice comms for me either. also didnt get points for a comp win
The difference lies in the pool size of the men vs. women. Due to fps shooters being culturally considered masculine (due to the violence, guns, etc.), far more boys pick it up than girls. As a result of this, when you have a vast populace of male valorant players, mathematically, there will be more highly skilled, pro-level players existing. Think about it this way, if there hypothetically are 10 million male valorant players and 1 million female players, and 0.001% of players make it pro, there would be 1000 female pros, and 10,000 male pros. This is not sexism nor misogyny, only objective math. I don’t understand how OP hasn’t considered the amount of female vs. male players and how that affects the pro scene. Clearly, the numbers I’ve proposed aren’t realistic as there are even fewer male pros, making female ones far and in between. Consequently, there does exist a skill difference in the upper echelons of valorant players when it comes to male and female gamers, as you have more males to pick from at a certain level, and far less females at the same level, due to the difference in populace. Correspondingly, you’re forced to either lower standards and have female players at a lower level compete in the regular vct, or make a separate branch called game changers.
He got an apology and his access in the end so...Billion dollar company that does this every early access? Kinda f-ed up no?
Just kill enemy and dont get killed yourself
I like playing:

Stinger on 2nd round as a run and gun maniac

Outlaw on 2nd round when holding long angles as it can oneshot people without full armor

Phantom if I'm not planning on playing long angles (still 1shot headshot but also able to run and gun)
Thanks for the explanation broda
Lol go find it then
Yep, like I really want to IGL, I love it but I just cant do it anymore...1/10 matches is actually enjoyable to comm. Listening to people backseat gets tiring very fast, ppl usually even in high immo have no fucking clue how to comm important stuff or play their agents. Im just gonna focus on myself and keep my sanity and mental up.
loud plays deadlock on lotus, and on pistol shes super annoying
when you think someone has good aim, you’re really thinking of how fast you die when you fight them in a duel, and that encompasses many things other than raw aim. Some immortals have worse raw aim than you, but their movement and crosshair placement outclasses yours. Its not an aim diff, its a gunfight technique diff
i dmed you ill send a link if you like
Por cierto, si hubiera alguna posibilidad de que me regalarán una skins, me llamo: "RivalBrow8310"

Muchas gracias a todos, con que solo miréis este video ya estoy feliz, pero lo dicho si existe la posibilidad también lo agradezco mucho.
not that im aware of, my gf tried to play a few days ago before the tmnt update and it wouldnt even load into fortnite before saying that it crashed. literally nothing wrong with her pc specs wise so im just assuming its some unsupported piece of hardware that fornite cant run on. maybe her cpu since its an iGPU series cpu or something. idk
I only had skins from battlepass. I always thought the bundles were sooo expensive and not worth it. Then a bundle with juste vandal, phantom and knife got out (Magepunk). I bought it, and i don't regret it.
Honestly I’m a brim viper main so, I’ve only ever heard that line when I pick Killjoy, which only happens on ascent and sometimes bind
i honestly dont see any point in engaging further into this convo, you obviously dont want to use comms in the first place so this would make as much sense as a believer trying to convince an atheist. Have fun out there, or something
Game sense is being able to make assumptions about how the other team is going to play and make decisions based on those assumptions.
Is the only comeback you have that plat lobbys don't differentiate from radiant lobbies? XD lunatic

But, you're "crying" right now.
Pretty sure that version is in the bonus styles
From my experience talking to transwomen (or at least, stealth women) its a compliment to forget their previous gender
mb guys my friend dint solo queue im so srry im a fraud i had no previous knowledge srry   
i have made a lapse in my judgement
Sadly, the game was 'designed' this way. A CO-OP gfame that rewards people for NOT doing any CO-OP. It's completely nuts. I wish they would allow us to create custom Lobby's that had a minimum combat score. Wanna join my game? Okay, you gotta get at least 1500 Combat score (or whatever score you set) to get the rewards.
Chamber 🤤🤤
Kinda off topic but I watched a video a while ago explaining why people don't really want a truly randomized "shuffle" button on Spotify for this exact same reason and how it's a constantly changing algorithm to try and appeal to the listener, but will inevitably always fall short. 

You'll be fine playing the same map back to back every now and then. It's basically an almost unfixable problem because it will introduce more problems to try and fix.
Performance anxiety, mostly happen when you dont want to lose and expect too much from yourself. Always remember that no one is perfect and we all mess up most of the time so it is okay. Put less stake on the game, dont forget to breath when aiming (this is big) and someone said to notice your mouse grip when you aim and get shaky you will be gripping the mouse super hard in those cases. Also, do not forget that it is a game in the end and try to enjoy it as much as you can.
The 'end when 15 survivors" is only fairly new really - previously it was also a set 20 min mission. There is always hope that build the Radar might get a vote or something similar once 5 are built. (maybe start a 2 min timer, to allow people to get the Radar reward / highlighted resources.
can u ping me when singtel fixes their shit? thankss
Even if you *are* great at getting headshots you should be buying Vandal/Phantom over Guardian whenever you can. 

You nearly triple your chance of getting that headshot kill in the time it takes to get another Guardian shot off.
IIRC the lower rank you are the more individual performance matters, higher ranks place more emphasis on team score differential
His molly is used to clear close angles & wall is used to isolate fights like Jett smokes. If you're mainly using Phoenix util to heal yourself then you're not optimally using it.
Got luna knife twice in a row and  i figure it out that i rly want it just after and then never seen it in 2 years, still waiting..
Honestly like 15 ish? I do mostly swift plays! If I'm playing really well and top fragging multiple games in a row I'll do comp once or twice. Swifts are fun and the lowest stakes ever so I prefer them.
Outlaw second round, ez bonus
Oh same I was just saying for OP it was only a Google search away lol

Leave the game right now and forget you ever installed valorant
it most certainly does not need a rework
Its a shotgun with many bullets. Each bullet does 34 damage, but it shoots many bullets at once. Its a shotgun.
Right now, im power level 92. Have up to 108 zones
Or they just used a RAT and changed it while using their PC.
Well be prepared to see her all the time because she's a 1v9 agent, pretty much the only one (next to Iso but he's new) that actually benefits from playing alone, and people really do not like to play a team game in a team-like manner. The only place where she's not in the top 3 by playrate is proplay
How deep in the red were you before these wins?
This is the definition of a shitpost. If bullets were 0.1 ms desynced from your gun, it would be VERY noticeable and VERY annoying.

The fact that you play with that setup is so scuffed dude.
I love how in your concept you can buy access to STW while inside the STW lobby. This is something the Devs would 100% do.
Oh yeah, the google doc one... I never had any luck with figuring that one out compared to other ways.
I can already see my monitor catching a straight because of this map
I'll give you some nuts n bolts and a Pl 34 hunter killer
Map geometry will tell you what their jiggle range is. They're gonna move towards cover if they're in the open, or they're gonna run wall to wall in an archway. They're at their slowest when they have to stop at either end, so try to predict which way they'll run and lead your crosshair.
Omen is so much fun. What do you play on breeze tho?
My Cypher trip kill last year. 1v1 me on attack, haven't planted yet and slowly moving to site while clearing angles, suddenly I hear the kill sound, Jett pops up in the killfeed, and we win the match
I understand that, but I'm not convinved that is the *primary* intent of that mechanic, when it's more likely that it's just much easier when coding the game to have the gun model retain the skin rather than changing it every time it's picked up
LoL is almost worse because they feed and snowballing in that game is a bit worse but yea it's shitty in both games.
1. You cant cheat
2. You can't use slurs without getting banned
3. You can't troll kick your teammates
4. You have to learn more than 1 character
5. The characters have contrast with the environment
6. Double the server tick rate
7. You have to learn multiple maps, not just Dust II

And these are the reasons the game is harder for you.

Joking aside, the utility has a learning curve, you have to know your agent and all the other agents and react strategically. The movement is quite different, its less floaty and a bit more static. The shooting is very different, you can reliably spray in CS, but in Valorant burst firing for 1 taps is better in a lot of situations. There's a lot you can take from CSGO but you have to treat it as a new game and learn the strategic and mechanical differences.
Thats so fun! Sorry for all the toxic players... Honestly they just bash everyone so its best to not let it get to you. You and your wife and more than welcome in the new server!
I literally explained why…Traders.
Plat 3 this act.
While thats true I would bet that pro teams literally have hundreds of people who want to try out at any given moment and they only have so much time to field those tryouts. So they need to make bets on if its worth the time to try someone out. They cant just let anyone who is not T1 be given the opportunity.
Cypher cages are super strong though. They are just so versatile. He can use them as jett smokes right after a kill. There's a trick where he can activate his cages instantly. His camera can patrol a whole site all on its own. And if hidden well won't even get broken. Riot should def nerf the cam. Make it only see a line of sight. (Non movable) That will make it balanced.
its amusing haha
Not only giving them money but also givim them free access of their pc with a rootkit aka vanguard! Nuked this sht from my hard drive.
cheating most likely, because most others are just account bans
This is accurate
Did you write down the email you used?
Yeah fur sure buddy
didn't know there's clans in a PvE game
Cypher's just too easy to counter. You can bait tripwire with yoru's clone (it works I've seen it as a cypher main) and just use any blind skill to stop his camera. One thing I always will remember ia that there's always a pattern to every operator you choose. And once the pattern is exposed, everyone's gonna use that as your weakness and win the match.
Stop playing sage and enabling people play what you want if you don't have smokes or a sentinel then tough
The average for CSGO is 2 and 400.
That is why I believe it's premature to claim his high pick rate is high. 


But if there are pickrate stats for ranked post-buff, I'd be curious to see that too. 
the current system isnt in place because they cant think of better one for the players, its in place because its a better one for them. the fomo system works too well
Average I guess, idk my storage is just full of traps and mats so I can build shit or scrap traps to build more shit
I would argue that raze has better value across a lot of the ranks than jett, especially after dash CD nerf and the one updraft. Something about being able to clear a lot of rat angles with raze between nade and boombot I just love it. 

Jett on breeze 100%, and if you're a God OPer
Thanks!! 
As far as I know there is a limit, yes. Unranked players can only queue with people who are in between iron 1 - gold 3. Which means if you are indeed that much better (plat 1 and above), you might not be able to play with him.

[You can check the competitive restrictions on this support website, scrolling down to the "CAN I PLAY COMPETITIVE WITH FRIENDS?" section.](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047937633-VALORANT-Competitive-Mode-FAQ)

The game also tells you why can't you queue on the bottom of the main page (right below the queue button), does that state anything? I believe you need to be the party leader to see that though.
When are the instruments for this coming out? We are may already.
There are like a thousand google searches and posts about this visual bug
as a harbor main, im just hoping its a good enough ball smoker for me to play on harbors bad maps.

he got to immo 3 400 rr
Clove has none of the rest of his kit so I don't see why a similar ult would make him redundant?

The revives have different use cases, and requiring a kill or assist before a timer runs out is a bit of a hindrance that Phoenix doesn't have.

The entire Riot balance team is pretty stupid overall. I feel like they don't know what they are actually changing and just blindly destroy the values.
Mill gracias me ayudo mucho, si me sirvió por completo.
Chamber is a great duelist/sentinel
Unfortunately it is more toxic then ever. Riot are doing nothing to stop it either. People who make personal insults and threats should get very long bans but that isn't they case currently. Imo it is only playable atm with everyone on mute in solo queue or with one or two friends on Discord.

There are about 1700 players in the NFL. If only the top 25 ("if you want to get crazy") don't suck at the game, then that means that 99% of players in the NFL suck at the game.
Definitely not been shared with anyone, we have figured it out, there is a difference account linked to xbox live, thanks buddy
i only played comp, maybe tdm if i can't play a full comp game
I have. Overwatch and League are both significantly worse in my experience.
that’s it, i’m gonna main controller. (been having a “role crisis” and never really played them) time to derank and rank back up
I don't know why you're getting down voted If you want to spend a weekend and your teens playing video games for 50 hours straight, more power to you! People hating are just jealous & mad because you get to spend more time on (y)our hobby than they did, and so they're pouring out their copium to downvote you and tell you you're wasting your life. But we all make silly decisions when we're younger and as long as you had fun, which it seems like you did, that's what really matters. Fuck all the haters
nah
No.
Valorant tracker?
Sova is comparatively easy. If you are playing in anywhere below high immo(even then this prolly still works). Just have a feel for when to throw recon. There is a lot of nuance to it but timing is way more important than the specific arrow lineup. Also after like 1000 hours you stop needing lineups and just like throw shit and it’ll land
Iron 2
I always had a middle of the road experience with kids. Sometimes they realise how much gameplay hours I put in valorant as an adult (yes, I'm crying) and they trust my judgement. But sometimes they just won't listen.

A kid was instantly dying every round due to lack of mobility as he was always carrying MGs. I exchanged my vandal with his ares. He got a kill. Took the enemy ares and threw the vandal.

One of them asked us to instalock without discussing because the agent select queue felt too long for his squirrel-like attention span.

Worst is when they talk while I'm trying to hear footsteps in a clutch situation.
Voltaic RAMP before games WHJ x VT Intermediate after you're done for the day
Wrong sub + that's a daily occurrence to me + ratio
Yeah but the problem is that the relative value of skins from game to game isn't as ridiculous as Valorant. It could've been 10$, but then a bunch if degenerates decided that 100$ was worth such a minor change to the game.
Drop the tracker let’s see your consistent “almost” 25 games.

I think I actually would recommend the Glitchpop over most, the sound is so different and crispy. But yeah, the reaver is always one I come back to
This issue here isn’t really the 5 stack though. The immortal player isn’t even top fragging his games because cielo who is “plat” is dumpstering the diamonds. The reason they’re destroying diamonds isn’t because they have one immortal to carry them but because the rest of the team (or at least some of them) are just smurfing which lets them face lower opponents then they should. 

5 stacking definitey makes this kind of smurf boosting easier but in a theoretical world without smurfing, the matches should theoretically be fair even with large skill gaps (in the sense that the teams are evenly matched).

s0m is good on every agent and knows tech for all of them, you can watch him to get better at every role
I'm somewhat low elo and mostly play to be a menace with a shptgun in my smokes, I don't think my screen is the first thing I need to change to get better ahaha

144 is gonna be enough for now as I don't want to blow a ton of money into it, mostly get a better image. I don't have the model either
Playboi
For me personally i hate the map rotating because it confuses me LOL
You should start by answering my questions first. Scroll up and answer every question i asked. If you dodging any of them don't expect a reply.
Does anyone know why they reverted the heavy restriction for 5 stacks that have huge differences in rank? Previously, immortal players queueing with low elo teammates would get like <5rr per win, then they changed it back.
I’m a firm believer that he’s either scientist or visitor, it makes sense and would be really cool to continue his story. I was also a bit upset that we didn’t get a fully accurate Vinderman, they nerfed his jaw lol

hmm... ok disabling the spatial sound does seem to make it playable, but with the windows sonic for headphones disabled, the sound in game is very specific. Like if there's someone exactly to the right of me, their sound comes from that side earpiece only. I don't know if this is better than before or maybe I'll just have to play for some time to get used to it. But before the update using both 'WSFH' and HRTF in game worked perfectly so I don't know why they changed stuff :(
Ah that sucks, I hope the advice others gave help you too! There's some really good suggestings, that's helped me already! :)
Never thought about that. That's a great point. Sage is the only one that doesn't have something that stays up all round. 

This is a reach, but Jett's passive of floating you can use all round, but it's not getting a ton of value.
Yo, coming from someone with serious health issues, these sound like serious health issues. please see a doctor asap.
I’m just saying I have no personal need for the feature and it’s often used which makes it more annoying than helpful. There are times it absolutely can help, but most of these things can be done when you’re dead anyway.
I really like the prelude stinger, shame I didn't feel the same way about the vandal. May it appear in your store 🙏
All that I mentioned.  Not sure which works, but it happened again last night.  Closed out discord and another game launcher, ran as admin and it loaded...
Hold on, let him cook
I would like to add to this by saying that crosshair placement is more important than straight aim. If you are already looking at the enemies heads there is no need to flick just click.

I've never seen a good Phoneix.
I'm Ascendant aswell, I find unless I start every game with a "Hello how are you all going?", comms don't really occur on their own. I've found people just don't really think of plans on their own so if you can come up with a good plan people are more likely to talk.
Would you risk your career to find out? I doubt many players want that massive spotlight on them and their team. It also takes away the spot light from the other players on the team so that could be another thing that causes friction.

I can not think of a good solution to this aside from some random team saying "fuck it" lets ball. And hopefully they win. Because if they don't then it's going to be a hard sell for other teams and that pressure, is again going to be very hard for players to deal with.
Ok.
I’m doing cypher only this whole act so my team is always gonna have a sentinel so I have to pray someone goes with smokes
You can “not give a fuck” all you want but this is a Valorant subreddit. If you want to spread you anti LGBT views I’m sure there’s an echo chamber subreddit for you somewhere.

Now that's better
Someone who uses exploits to duplicate their materials. Lots of people do this and then can place tons of traps. This is against epics ToS and you can be banned for it but enforcement seems to be lacking. I enjoy playing the game though so I don't want to use exploits. People in this sub see lots of traps and instantly start saying it's a super but I run expeditions daily and main a farming hero so I always have way more traps than I need. And no matter how many traps I place I seem to always have an increasing inventory.
You're seriously suggesting a random spray pattern promotes a higher skill ceiling than a pattern you need to actually master? 
Learn to play all roles to a good level and then you’ll know your strengths and weaknesses. 2-3 months is no time at all compared to the likes of tenz put in a consistent grind and no reason you can’t get there. Goodluck!
100% agreed. he doesn't need a buff, people just need to stop picking him when they haven't put the time into learning him
The issue with your statement is that I never said different mice can't produce different results. I simply stated that the op should find what mouse they find comfortable and the best for them. What I mentioned was that for me personally I like a slightly heavier mouse and that is what is comfortable for me. You're taking my statement as if I said them as fact to which I did not and you simply interpreted them incorrectly.
I have an average mic and a pop filter that my boyfriend helped me set up because he knows way more about it than I do. When I talk in game it is always one of three things haha. 

1) “Do you stream?” because it sounds nice and i have a wild ign.
2) people who are completely chill and nice
3) sexist people or people who just say really gross things/want me to say really gross things. 

I sympathize with the weird mic things. I’m sorry you have to mute people. It sucks having to penalize yourself by not having comms because people suck.
 If I dropped people for not wanting to play my specific games… gonna have a pretty short list of friends.
I find them meh
I will probably get it, but will see. I already have Araxys Vandal and I don't think this skin sounds similiar at all.

Relationships can be of any type and aren’t exclusive to being married or having kids. I agree that those are on a decline, especially in this economy. However, relationships themselves are a fundamental part of human nature and are not on a MASSIVE decline. It is on a decline because the technological advancements are causing for a more isolated society, but most people still seek out each other to fulfill their social and possibly romantic/sexual desire
Probably skye based on these likes.
Valorant is 20% aim, 50% movement, 30% positioning from my experience. I’ve noticed my positioning matters more than my aim, and my movement matters more than both by a substantial amount. If you are losing gunfights, and you’re certain that aim isn’t the problem, you’re probably swinging, strafing, and positioning poorly.
I’m a Sova main. I like all the maps but I would have to put Split at the bottom for me. Unlike other maps, I feel like I have to ACTUALLY memorize lineups often on Split compared to other maps.
other people wont, so its good to be cautious about who youre hanging out with. its fine wanting to not willingly expose urself to stuff like that, it aint fun
That's right
His trips were also infinite range like Cypher trips and his ultimate had a firerate of 1.2, it's 0.9 now, a normal operator is 0.6

Riot nerfed some parts of his kit but left his double teleport anchors untouched so he was still picked up until the end of 2022, it wasn't until they hard nerfed every ability in the off season that he fell out of the meta.

Riot has since buffed every ability except for his teleport.
Was on tokyo for a year, they don't like you if you don't speak japanese, but that's only when they're just shit humans though, a lot just play silently as is the trend for riot games.

No comms?

 Comms is a luxury tbh

2nd of all this is the STW sub so it isn't even the correct place to cry in, BR sub is r/FortniteBR.

Yeah they look very similar to plants vs zombies zombies.

Uninspired trash can of a game lol
you gotta fuck around and find out to learn the game and personally I wouldn’t enjoy the game if I wasn’t good at it/improving at it. If you don’t know what you’re doing you’re going to die a lot to a lot of bs but as you get better you’ll stop dying as much and that’s when it starts to feel fun. If you don’t like the game or don’t wanna get better at it no harm in just dropping it if you don’t have fun but you do you lol

I like RoyalG’s content. He’s not smurfing if he’s playing in ascendant+ lobbies and only using a classic, or playing in immo lobbies with only a deagle. I like most of Keeoh’s content, although there are some of his videos, especially in the Fade speedrun, before there was a massive backlash against smurfing content, where he would duoQ with Jollz and Jollz was on Omen trying to only get knife kills. Smurfing on golds isn’t really fun content, but the challenge runs he does are fun. He did a no rifle to radiant video that’s really good, pretty much stinger and op only. His nuzlocke series was quite good. AverageJonas doesn’t really smurf but I don’t really like his content that much after the beef with westjett. Ziptie is probably my favorite yoru creator simply because he does dumb shit and somehow makes it work. At least a few creators there that don’t actively smurf.
Thanks makes sense. I know how the game works from playing cs (peaked 2 ranks below global) I know what micro means. I just got placed it’s not like I’m hard stuck bronze. My aims consistent with the high sens but I agree it’s not worth the handicap of having to be so heavily concentrated in how I’m moving my mouse less than a cm. Moved down to .55 and feel a lot better already
Yeah I got that I was making a joke. It’s extremely obvious where you should plant if you just use even a little bit of intuition, it doesn’t require game sense, it requires having a brain. It’s not like iron players are dumber than the average person. A hardstuck iron though? Yeah hopeless

Any headshot rate is fine, but I go for above 20% and with vandal, I go for 25%-35%
How would you feel if you won a game but lost 20 RR? That is essentially why MMR and RR are separate. Sure concepts like increasing play time to hit your RR peak and whatever might be bonuses, but in a true MMR/Elo system for a team game your play is what affects your MMR gain/loss, so bottom fragging on a winning team can reduce your MMR. This obviously feels bad when you sweat out a win and then lose RR, why even play for the win instead of personal stats?

By hiding MMR and displaying a rank that is 90% W/L and 10% personal performance, you incentivize team play and keep players mental higher by always giving them a positive number after a win (even if they deserve a negative number)

It also allows them to enforce some rank inflation which encourages players to keep playing. De-rank protection, MMR starting every episode above RR, etc.

I believe Riot originally had a visible MMR system in League of Legends Season 1, and they quickly deviated from it, because it sucks for players to actually see how they move up and down the ladder
Learn how every agent works, make use of your mini map for intel, low Elo comms are shit. Low Elo being plat as well.
I just caved and bought ion vandal for full price as it appeared in my store. By the time a proper vandal I like appears in my night market I'd probably have quit valorant
Yeah our character just falls to the ground flat dead like what used to happen in BR, but gameplay wise the little robots respawn us like what happens in BR
new immortal buddy 0.0
Then why not just learn cross map recons so you can scan nothing there too and still be confused on your role as an info gatherer?
You need a high player count in order to have fast queue times...
don’t know which maps this applies to, but the current kj maps like ascent, icebox, lotus, sunset. 
All have ways to make use of the turret’s ranged visibility to watch flank, while fully being in planting range

Man I can try and educate you or just ask you politely just to search up what vanguard has done in the past. Im gonna choose the latter. 

Vanguard has already been shown to read google searches, applications, even phones plugged in. 

There’s a reason why people hate Vanguard the most out of all the other kernel levels.
My beloved Omen who's the only character I love ti play will probably once again go back to the dustbin in the meta like how they nerfed him when Astra released 😂
I don't know who would use this on PC with games that don't support aim assist. You'll never find a player using these in high level Team Fortress 2 matches, like they do with the Dual Sense.

Exactly. Servers are down rn.

I got bored off cs but I do miss the community. Valorant audience is a lot younger then cs and it shows with getting toxic really fast, throwing for no reason etc. Cs has a bad name but compared to valorant it is way more mature in higher elo.
I’m somewhat right there with you kinda just been stuck in ascendant two to just under ascendant 3. There’s a lot of things that can play a role in winning or losing but honestly keeping your mental is a massive part of winning. Between keeping team moral high and just having good positioning it can take you a long way. I think aim is definitely important because sometimes it can get you out of alot of the situations as well as just trying to be aware at all times. If you aren’t swinging getting info from util, your teammates, and the map is massive in allowing you to make your next move. I’ve seen many players with much worse aim than me(not trying to have an ego..) win a round simply because they were in the right spot at the right time or did something to set the team up for success with util or info. For me personally k try to aim train maybe 15 mins a day or so just to help myself get more confident and consistent since having a warmup can help set the tone for the day. Unless you are feeling it only queue maybe 2-3 games a day at max. Hopefully this helps!
what the fuck is wrong with you

Turn monitor down to 15% like any sane person.
I hit immortal ep 5 , stopped playing immediately after for about a year. Came back to the game and got placed into plat/dia. Anytime I have a bad game, teammates instantly dog on me for being a washed imm(which I technically am). But it’s just annoying getting dogged on for accomplishing something 90% of them wish they could do.
if you'd like; another way to build the weapon *is* just a basic ass, boring, full attack speed paleo luna build. the astro bat's unique attack combined with its powerful 6th perks can make it a more than viable luna weapon. you can get a ton of mileage out of heavy attacks, even if you never build it for heavy attacks.

the natural long range and AOE characteristics of the heavy attack greatly compliments paleo luna's typical weaknesses. its genuinely one of the best weapons you could pick for luna, only problem is its in direct competition with the storm king's ravager.

>Clove should be 1st or 2nd in line in the site execute because they can still smoke after dying, they have an overheal after a kill, and with ult they can self-rez.

i think this is what people think makes her individualistic. her death is low impact for the team, and she doesn't really have much util that combos well with her team (her decay is a good combo piece but most cloves just chuck it vaguely in the enemy direction then run off anyway). while she does need to execute with her team, during the actual execute, where she goes doesn't really matter as much, she can honestly just run off and push her own smokes and half the time that's not even a bad play.

I do, but not in a situation where the enemy team is so ahead we literally have to win 10 rounds and not give any rounds away. Its so tilting winning 7-8 rounds and then the enemy wins 1 or 2 and its gg.

Tbh it will pass. I played Clove a few games and honestly to me she's not much to a controller. I feel like Viper and Omen are much better compared to her.

Plus, they're learning. I've been overbuilding since I don't know the spawn locations for each defense point. I still need to learn more compact designs for my builds, but I've been getting better at recognizing when certain traps are most useful.
As a fair warning, you can burn out in the mode, so probably not worth buying something expensive, people usually only have founders for Vbucks, aside from that, guns and characters are in a good variety that lets you beat content without needing founder stuff

You are playing too many games in one day, quality over quantity, you shouldn't play more than 5 games an a day, and no more than 3 in a row, you are doing yourself a disservice by playing so many games and especially on a losing streak. Use that addition time to train mechanics, VOD review, watch pros, and make playbooks.

It’s John Valorant
Ascendant 3 here, playing on 60Hz laptop. 

I use guardian too and prefer guardian + full shield over vandal/phantom + light shield. Not only it helps me manage my economy but also improves my aim overall as I can simply pick my dead teammates vandal(if any). My HS % with guardian is 67% whereas with Vandal, it’s 42%. 


So I suppose I am more than qualified to answer your question - Use guardian til its max potential. Folks saying that you can’t spray in close range are probably stuck in gold or platinum and can’t position themselves well.

Obviously there will be some scenario where a vandal would’ve won you that dual but if your aim is goated, you’re bound to win more gun fights by clicking heads.
Do a team death match between games
tbh that's better than over buffing. Just look at what happened in OW1 and what's currently happening in Apex

I mean surrender should be 5/5. Remake i 3/5 sounds good
Very cool. This could be a nice wallpaper.
being in the spotlight of the team (aka duelist) is much easier mentally than being the background character that's got little expectation of good performance

also astra and fade are definitely not designed like most female characters, and there are tons of female jett players in ranked. like i said, female character aesthetic is just different but what you say is mostly true in the lowest elos (no higher than silver)

no one is playing spike rush to work on their rank, if that's the reason then they're making the game way too focused on comp and ignoring the fun part >!bring replication back!<
yes, you are in the wrong sub. Yes, you found a bug. does this count in royal rumble?
Is that a new hero or wtf
This game is literally the least toxic game there is now
This triggers me a little, people will ask to drop skins but almost never on what they are going to do in a round.
Nope omen main
and PS: some ppl throw their first 5 games to smurf and get a lower rank

They reduce spawn caps and only target players

So… don’t stand on the objective. You shouldn’t normally, but extra don’t now
It took you over 1,000 missions to get out of plankerton 😂 that’s the real gem here
[removed]
We were defending and they planted the bomb and our phoenix was the last one alive at the bottom of the map.... So they probably were laughing too haha
you’re in the Save the World subreddit, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortniteBR
You got banned in STW!? Wow man, achievement unlocked! 👏
People seriously should learn to rage without pressing V
Alright, so just keep instalocking raze?
Those teammates that choose to be duelist or initiator but like to keep lurking. Always MIA every round. 

Much worst those who keeps hugging the spike but don't have any plan to Plant it.
It’s just dumb that you can’t play any close angles against that agent, it’s so oppressive in ASC-IMM

Bad
Don’t play br

All maps are coming back
I played against that dude playing gekko, could also just be multiple ppl w the same funny name tbh
Rushing plant will almost always result to one side getting wiped out. Holding the spike and spreading out gets on the defense' nerves, making them prone to doing mistakes more easily.
Right but I think people complain because of an asc lvl play jumps on a low lvl alt and plays unrated he’s gonna just shit on 70% of the lobby. How is that fun for anyone?
Killjoy is super cheap for her much impact her util has. 600 credits and all her utility is good.
Bro thats like 9 traps!  you are given enough mats at the beginning to make about this many CELs, A few darts, etc.
I just want him to be invulnerable white teleporting 😭 I die in the tp way too much
I agree it shouldn't have to be that way but it is that way so just keep muting the toxic and leaving the good ones unmuted.

 Also just keep giving comms through chat whether they listen or not because practicing good comms is good.

And ik u want to hear comms and all but it's better to try to play without comms than pure toxicity.
Ahhh I see, I'll be more aware
yay rage post!
It feels strong on defense
Every now and then. The Alien weapons was a pleasant change of pace, and I'm remaining hopeful we get another set of guns. Like the Auto Sniper or Heavy Assault Rifle.
Game does really fucking need a replay system though lmfao. I'm convinced the only reason it doesn't is so the community isn't able to easily identify just how many cheaters there really are.
They shutdown matchmaking 30 mins before downtime
If you're practicing and playing the game there's no point getting ranked anxiety, bc losing one game is irrelevant, it's how many you win in comparison to how many you lose over a period of time that matters. You can lose 3 in a row but who gives a fuck bc we all know at some point you'll go on a winning streak that's just how it goes. Don't get anxious just have fun and watch your rank go up and be proud of yourself

Hope they don’t take off ascent or haven 💀
Agree. I’ve lost many rounds to team mates saying “backsite” when in fact they were flank, it’s ridiculous
Kind of like Rocket League, I love Rocket League, I played it a lot (2k+ hours) and I got to Champ 3 many times in 2v2 and 3v3 and I can just copium my losses and I'm pretty chill in victory or defeat.

I play 1v1 and I am just absolutely furious. I think moreso because the game is so bullshit at times, you commit to a 50/50 challenge and they win the ball now your net is open and they roll it in spamming What a Save! over and over
Breach is toxic as it is
Like this? `0;P;c;6;o;1;0t;4;0l;4;0o;1;1l;4;1o;0;1a;1`
ok you people better know what is this, fortnite is keeping installing for 3 times and now it going over 200GB (its downloading), fortnite folder however still last as 45GB, but Idk why this took so long and its jus don't end!
True. "Yes, I was smurfing but no malicious intent" lmao. Dunking on irons and other ranks several tiers below you, while using a classic, is basically you emphasizing that you're so much better than them. And for what? To entertain your viewers? What a joke this guy is.
You want fun? CIA show you fun.
the skill range is set when they confirm their team so because of some weird mmr issues you cant join them until the next premier starts
I would say cypher trip but it's kinda niche to say that. But I mean... giving deadlock something unique would make her more interesting, right ?
That is just not the case at all. Hidden MMR stays the same between acts, so you would be playing in the same skill group as the previous one.
not having vc doesn’t seem THAT serious. i have a good reason not to use my vc
Or you get the kids that are in all those videos that go "haha now I have skin, noob" and run away without buying you back

(Don't know the videos? Just search "Jett give me skin" and they'll take over your YouTube front-page)
You need all that stuff. Legendary and epic survivors, legendary hero at the end, all levels of perk ups, re perk, evolution materials, Legendary trap and weapon schematics. And gold. Even if it's duplicates you recycle for more good stuff like training manual, etc.

Are you already PL 144 with schematics for all traps 144 and your weapons also Level 144 and all have god rolled perks? If so I guess then whatever.

Exactly the same here. I have so little aim that I have more knife kill than ghost kill... I don't know if I should feel ashamed or proud..

I'd rather just pay like $50 for a pay per view than $25 for a dogshit pistol skin that I won't be seeing (or rarely seeing) past round 2 every match. That way it's an actual significant amount to support > the off-chance people buy a skin. Not only would this provide both a more reliable, accurate metric to measure their online viewing presence for Valo eSports, but also better for marketing to sponsers/supporters for the orgs (to run ads, etc...).

At least the VCT knives I can see frequently when swapped for rotations due to the MS difference, but in no situation will I ever been whipping out a classic for the same reason.

Overwatch and apex benefit from a higher sensitivity because you need to be able to aim 360 degrees around you in a lot of cases due to movement and abilities. Val/Cs is much more slow paced with 1 shot kills where if you aren’t looking the right direction, you should be dead instead of turning and taking a fight. 1 shot hs means lower sense to get right on the head first shot is generally beneficial
And not crouching
I think they do. I see others selling online. That's how I remembered them. I have been playing on PC and I can't see them but when I log in on my Xbox I still have 2 codes. I have not tried to click them or anything yet as I don't want to waste them accidentally or something.
honestly i find builds like bow ones and zenith so lame  
i just use my AR build for everything but ventures
Yep you just proved my point with the mald, thank you.

For ventures i always use Blakebeard's stash team perk up until late zones since the Pegleg will always be much higher level until late zones and even on same level as husks it will be very good, plus cannonbals for crowd clearing, honestly, it is quite OP. Yesterday i just started ventures for this season, PL 1-6, in 15 zones, my teammates literally stopped playing because my mission score is 5x what all of them combined have. On 144 supercharged Luna i start with lrvel 67 pegleg...

So loadout is :
- Paleo Luna as lead
Blakebeard stash perk
- Blakebeard Blackhearted - boosts cannonballs 20%
- Privateer Hype - boosts pegleg 17%
- Goin' cocounts guy (forgot hero name) - don't neee him as 2 pirates above already activate perk but without him the cocounts from stash will only heal, won't add 16% damage bonus
- Breakbeat Wildcat - to activate rocking riff every 9 elims for even further 50% damage and 32% swing speed
- Deadly crash - just because, donno what else haha

However, in my regular Twine missions i use either Luna standard melee build with critsploding Stormblade or standrad contructor. And when in mood, standard bow build with Farah and either Xenon or Vacuum bow.
He’d still probably be picked as he is a good SECONDARY controller. If someone is rivaling viper that doesn’t make harbor useless. His current rival is astra since they’re flex controllers or secondary controllers (I.e. agents your flex will pick in a pro environment). Astra brings a bit more defensive utility and sentinel-Esque tools whereas harbor brings a more retake/attack-centric toolkit purely focused on denying vision. In other words, harbors strength is his power in site executes and retakes - whether riot designed him that way or not viper doesn’t replace him and will see play where viper wouldnt
I just hit bronze and I was so proud of myself until I realised that diamond is mid elo
I don't agree that controller is 100% the most *impactful* role, but I will say I think that controller has a *ton* of hidden impact that isn't noticed by non-controller mains and isn't directly rewarded by Riot's RR system in ranked.
I think I watched too much Naruto but I cant accept that I cant be as good as someone else if I grind hard enough lol
I'm on the beta too.  
What helped for me:

* try agents in Training and unlock those you enjoy the most. As u/Uncoiledyt said, you'll be better if you like the style of the agent.
* Change the aim cross to a small size can help you aim.
* Don't move and shoot. Seriously, don't.
* Play team deathmatch to learn aiming, agent, weapons as it's a quick respawn/fun
They suck, but people that use the excuse: “I can’t climb because my team suck, and I only play vs Smurfs” are worse
I got the night sky variants for fade. The percussion sound s really good. I guess since it followed up the imperium skins people already had their fill of eastern asian skins.
Xerofang, Reaver, Prime

[removed]
even if you'd play other roles, there's strategy and stuff you could go through, but nope, someones gotta start crying because their gun doesn't glow
I mean it's your own fault if you dedicate your entire game time to one agent. This is a game where you need some kind of variety to get anywhere.
I think understand what you're getting at. You're viewing this from a gameplay consistency standpoint, right? And not so much from a balancing standpoint? If so, I also agree. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
Bro should i sent you a screen shot right now ? Just go into the looking for game tab. There you can find a lot of scam accounts that don´t actually play the game.
If you’re under Immortal elo there are enough free resources out there that are probably more beneficial for you. Even though he’s unpopular the Banana guy has some good stuff.
Prx sunset at madrid? All I remember for deadlock is that one eg icebox vs g2
While I agree that you should stop coping, it's completely not false that it happened to me couple of times in low & mid elo that I had a great game as a Reyna main and people started throwing.

It's unfortunate when you popoff and some rando start throwing then the next game you bottom frag and get flamed. Didn't happen a lot but I remember the couple of times it happened.

Anyway long story short I improved and if you drop 30 kills in asc/immo nobody cries about smurfing anymore \[mostly\], people have new ways to coping like crying about cheating.
I believe you can get them in the store under the accessories(?) tab, could be wrong though and it'd be pretty rare to get the specific buddy.
00:28 That was exactly why I asked for a Toggle-Mute button. But I got downvoted to oblivion


We have a clutch mute, not toggle mute. We need toggle mute, not Clutch mute.
No knives, vandals, phantoms, or spectres. No gold skins at all. Only notable skins I got are soulstrife ghost and sakura sheriff
I dodge for 3 reasons consistently.. #1) insalock reynas 2) triple instalock/or even slow lock duelists (at least 2 lying out duelist skills), 3)clove on team until after hype..

They may be pro but % don't agree woth even giving them a chance.. I'll take my 30 min/3hr ban.. I've tried.. ego destroys games when a new agent hits.. just wait till next act..
Happened to me yesterday. I just restarted the game and the items were in my inventory
Too much pew pew, aim go bad. Good balance of pew pew and strafing, aim good.
Oof rip I didn't realise there was a sign up for the beta and only just signed up...I'm guessing it's too late right?
Yeah this is just so people wouldnt complain about not getting the new rewards
Sometimes you just gotta fuck around for the fun of it lmao
In the face of AI-generated animations with AI-generated voices I take comfort in seeing real people making and voicing animations. Even if the quality is highly questionable I'll always value art like this more than I value AI-generated slop.
Some people play to enjoy and when people enjoy, sometimes they forget to think, when they think too much it becomes stressful. I noticed this in the lobby. The first rounds they are having fun but nothing ever works and when we put strategy they lose their minds and starts to play worse. I guess they still don't have the strategic mindset in them.
Understand the layout of the dungeon.... and it can all be solo'd relatively easily. Just don't get into too much of a rush as that's where pretty much everyone screws up.
There's a reason everyone is in the rank they are. An Omen with bad smokes checks out for bronze. Same way a duelist with bad aim would also check out or a Sage who only self-heals and doesn't use ult to revive anyone either half.
You used to be able to 100% a Daily Destroy Quest by entering a town/city and firing across the map, it’d just Killdozer the entire map at once. Truly a glorious time
Ah yes... now I remember. Although me being able to know a Clara, I’d have to leave the house and get decent at socializing with women. I’m safe then *bada-bing*
>Mirror matchups are quite literally required for “(agent) diff”

Yeah for an “(agent) diff”, do you think they're referring to an agent diff in a video called "YOU DIFF" (Also at the end where they say think diff, play diff, you diff)? Again in this video they're referring to a player diff not an agent diff, using the name of the agent is just an easy way to blankly refer to a player without saying their name, this is further clear when they place names of players behind the diff

>As per your instructions I have played the game a lot (too much) and have never heard someone call an agent diff without the same agent on the other team.

There isn't really a way to guarantee you'll run into the usage of the word but a personal anecdote of you never encountering the usage doesn't really disprove the point I was making 

>Riot misused the term in this case

They didn't, they made it pretty clear they're referring to the players not agents throughout the entire trailer
That’s the whole point. She’s an initiator not a duelist. She’s designed to initiate for her teammates not herself. That’s the whole point of every initiator. To set up for their teammates. Duelists are the ones who are supposed to set up for themselves. If every initiator could peek off their own utility then duelists would have no use because their utility is inherently worse than initiators but they have the advantage of being able to more easily play off their own utility.
As a kj player, Ascent is my favourite map, second place goes to Haven. The setups you can do on both maps are so fun, and the ult spots too. Chef’s kiss

that’s corny cause it’s valorant not the world

CSGO has a console version.
For long range shooting ig but who even uses a bucky for long range lol

could you explain to me how gender identity is a western ideology?

and how does your point stand with kj / raze being a thing? please make up better reasons on why representation shouldnt be a thing in valorant
Okay pls don’t judge me

What if I told you I was accidentally ignoring the decimal point this whole time
Why is so much about improving aim
Search up dasnerth,he literally became #1 radiant by judge only
Aim isnt everything,valorant has abilities for a reason
Even if you have the best aim in the world good util usage from enemy will fuck you over
According to val tracker:  
Unrated: 13 fb, Neon 20 rounds  
Ranked: 11 fb, Jett 22 rounds  
Premier: 11fb, Jett 17 rounds
neon slide is not like jett dash or a get out of jail free card.
neon dash is best used to wide swing an enemy and throw them off.
What you see in the video is just basic crosshair placement and game sense.
Let alone that you can’t actually practice comp in quickplay, lots of people like me enter that mode to fuck around and have mindless fun
boosted as frick*
Seems like fun. XD . I am deranking to bronze from A3 very soon. Switching back to old laptop from my gaming pc. I used to be hardstuck bronze on that laptop
I'd say just stop pushing long routes where op has advantage, say like heaven go garage and rush op or just go B or A use same tactic on other maps. I like to try to cover the gap I play brim and smokes alot so I like to blind every bit and rush through my smokes at op users/marshal and take them out close range sure I'll die maybe but least I can take out the sniper.
Not true at all.

Plus just because you can control a spray does not mean you should. Regardless of your abilities, spraying just invites human error. You'll see pros MAYBE spray at mid range.

But to be fair you can say the same in Valorant. Bullet deviation vs spray pattern didn't really make much of a difference in the end I don't think. Truth is tapping and bursting have always been better options except in niche case scenarios or at close range. 

As for run and gun it's not much better. Actually I would say the Vandal is better at running and gunning.
It's only bad when that's all you do, at any range. Low elo players do it too much, and it becomes a bad habit. Usually, strafe bursting is better

What I love to do is hold an angle wide (around 5 to 10 m away), crouch down, wait for enemies to push. Gets me the kill 99% of the time.

As long as you hit the first bullet, it's overpowered, since you have a slight advantage, as they don't always expect you to be crouching

Never crouch in more than 30 meters though, unless you have a get out for free util like a tp or dash.

Also, never crouch when there's more than 1 enemy there, and they are more than 15 meters away. If they are within 15 meters, you can spray transfer them, but the further away the harder it is to do that
[removed]
the scoreboarddoes not matter at all, the only thing that matters is you own combat score compared to the lobby. even enemies. so if the enemies all got maybe 3 with 20k and you only got 14k but are mvp of your team, thats still a hefty rr loss regardless.
Sell your soul
Glad to hear it
cause everyone in my comments are "it doesn't matter who you play unless your in a pro league" I genuinely don't care I'm asking r/valorant the reason why I put up this post is to ask "IS NEON META/VIABLE" and clearly the giant title on the front of the post isn't enough for people to get a hint that's why I edited it TWICE
My friends are casual console gamers, so solo q is the only way
Well there’s your answer
Bro I’m doing good how is it sabotaging
I’m like PL60, used to use that scythe loadout, and still have it equipped after my 5 year hiatus. I think it was with harvester Sarah. No clue if it’s still viable in higher level stuff but at least where I’m at in canny I’m still 1 shotting most husks, 2 shotting huskies and medics and 3/4 shotting mist monsters, with light attacks. If the scaling is somewhat similar between 60 and 160 I guess it could be somewhat viable? Idrk
exactly, as much as FF will sometimes let you get "one more game in" they still treat the extra time saved as if it stacks when it does not
(bronze 2)

weak mental
assume your a smurf if u frag high
whole team stops playing after two games

for people like me who are NB it feels good to have representation its def not a bad thing. there will always be people who are gonna cry that val has gone woke but thats only a loud minority
* **Meddle (Q):** Envelopes Clove with a glow and disrupts nearby abilities that are deployed by the adversaries. However, not all details about this ability have been fully disclosed yet.
* **Ruse (E):** Allows Clove to throw a smoke orb, which will suppress audio or generate fake gunshots when an opponent steps into it.
* **Pick Me Up (C):** After activating this ability, Clove will leave behind a device identical to a backpack. If Clove takes any damage and dies while the backpack is active, their teammates can bring them back/revive them.
* **Flight Path (X)/Ultimate:** Clove launches herself into the air along with numerous butterflies. Apart from this, no information is available regarding Clove’s Ultimate **Flight Path**.

Shorty gang
Going from mid to A is the worst thing happened to me everytime
Yep lol, I can’t anymore w trashlock players, pls stop playing her
That crash report doesn’t say much. Got an error code? Is it maybe 0xc000009a?
The biggest problem with Breeze is the lack of agent diversity and the biggest problem on Icebox is the lack of strategic diversity. Every game on Breeze has like the same 7 agents and every game on Icebox is 5 man A or 5 man B. Maybe once in a while someone plays an off meta agent on Breeze or lurks mid on Icebox but the vast majority of games play out the same, which makes the maps less fun.

Personally I don’t find Icebox that bad but as someone whose aim is bollucks, Breeze has less options for using utility because of all the long angles and thus I’m forced into aim duels more often, which makes my win rate on the map god awful. But that one is just a personal skill issue tbf
Any idea how long?

If you're struggling this hard, it's a pretty good sign you should stop playing comp for a while, this isn't healthy lol
Let me know about your findings.

Do you even know how sova dart works ? It can reveal and i just looked at the radar i do not need to look at him directly to know where he is
I've noticed many oeople havingvthis same issue even 6 moth back but is seems to be fixing it self, but I've been having the problem for 3 days :(
i totally understand taking out game modes, if they left all of them in queue times would be terrible, spike rush already takes me 5+ mins to get a game
because they're cringey, and usually one underperforms and the other overperforms as they're smurfing for one another
Last time I left a comment on this kind of post, the post got removed later. I believe someone is moderating this type of self promotion, if not by you.

A good map is subjective between players as it all depends on your playstyle. I still remember the days when everyone hated Fracture and I took advantage to learn and master it for easy wins. The moment it left, everyone pretends they never asked for it to leave.

These different agent are the main difference. Find someone that you like. Every agent is playable.
wait is this real?
Save the world is pretty buggy so I can see it happening

Update your drivers
depends on my aim that day + the map; usually it's ghost/sheriff light shield or stinger/marshal but depends because if it's a tight map like sunset I'll get a stinger/sheriff but if its long distance like abyss ill get a marshal since i can at least hit someone 101 + team mates pick it up + accurate w/o ADsing
Looks like they tried adding the battle pass levels, but failed miserably. I think the level only shows for yourself, and not the other players.
process of elimination
Will be really interesting to see how it affects B long.

it wasn't. They said in an interview the outlaw was added to bridge the gap between the op and marshal, as they felt the difference was too big
A few things to remember:
1) we all get nervous, I’m currently radiant and I also get nervous, but that’s just a natural feeling for all players
2) it’s unrated, have fun with it! It’s the best time to relax a little and get used to those situations (and trust me that when you get into more of those situations you will figure out how to win more 1vXs.
3) as long as you are positive and keep the vibes positive for the team, don’t sweat about how you are playing, it’s true when people say positivity can win games as when everyone gets tilted, no one listens to each other, comms die, etc.

In other words, just keep playing and have fun with it, it’s better for your mental and can be even better when trying to improve as a player.
i miss the old queue music :(
I started to think all the LA stuff was just because of VCT LA, but it still seems like there could be an LA map.  I wonder where Landfall or Kingdom West is supposed to be.   Could very well be Santa Monica, at Riot.
If you have an initiator, ask them to use their util. Otherwise, see the other replies.
Ping difference can cause these
Almost 29. Hit Immortal and lost any motivation to play seriously after that. Game got 10x harder once I was in high Immortal 2 and 3 lobbies and it made me realize there’s no point for me to go further.
That why I deleted the post so I can add it to that
I've been Ascendant for several acts/episodes. I don't think it's very impressive at all. When I look at other Ascendants, sometimes I question how they got to this rank. And, when I self-VOD review, I question how I even got to this rank.

The reality is that there is a massive skill gap between your average Ascendant and your average high Immortal player, which is probably where most streamers are coming from.

Is Ascendant better than Gold/Platinum/Diamond? Sure. But most people can hit Ascendant if they're semi serious about the game, do VOD reviews, analyze pro plays, etc. And even if you hit Ascendant, most likely you are still not playing "proper" Valorant yet, as there is constant inconsistency between what a top player would expect vs what actually happens in Ascendant/low Immortal lobbies.
Valorant X overwatch?
Oui!
I play Chamber for the one taps
Because bronzes want to instalock reyna and blind people through walls and hate that an agent can push them

When I play dm for warmup, should I always use phantom/vandal? Typically I will only use sheriff/guardian during my first dm.
Agreed
What is the disrespect to viper mollies in this thread, viper molly plus stinger one of the hardest things to push off a tight angle and should not be that good at medium range.

She's probs one of the best agents, but just hard to learn
Not every headshot is an insta kill and wallbang headshots make less damage
Yeah they’d have to sell low just to hope to make something out of something that’ll soon be worth nothing. Either way, screw scalpers in general.
If you really wanna get technical you should also factor in the size of your monitor as well
100%
If your on PS it's people not realizing their controller mic is active

To be fair I don't understand why game parties have always been so shit. I get better servers cost more but come on. Look at how far the likes of Discord has come

Went from picking up everything to almost perfectly removing background noise
love to hear that bro! <3
ok my main phases were stupid complicated. i started maining Sova and top fragging but after that I became very inconsistent. then i switched over 3 duelists back and forth all over the place until landed on raze. after that cluster fuck i went through controllers brimmy and viper to be specific i became bad on viper but good at brimmy so i maind brim for 3 months until i landed on sentinels my two mains for life were kill joy and cypher my two best agents
Ascent or breeze
Correct which this isn’t truly an issue as the visible ranks are making people think their opponents are far ahead of them. By waiting the visible ranks will settle themselves out more and make players like OP feel better.
How long does it take for emails to be sent letting you play the game?
It doesn’t take much effort to share your skins tbh.  It’s also good for the team morale. I love to share my skins cause I know there are some unfortunate players who can’t afford them.
nah definitely still I'd the case lol, got my clove making one ways for the enemy, and their clove straight up smoking their own entries
What skin is that?
Make it like CS, you can enter and leave as you wish without penalties.
I just report anyways because either they said it and they'll get punished or they never said it and nothing happens anyways
Oof
Those weren’t cheaters my friend, those were smurfs, if you’re anything below diamond, those were just people bored or not good enough to play in their own lobbies so they decided to play in yours, not cheaters lmfao

How do you do it?
I've been playing since beta D: and only made it out of bronze very briefly once. I think maybe the first season I did comp (which wasn't till like maybe the 5th one?). Since then it's been bronze all the way. Only really play once a week with friends but we 5 stack and just never seem to get any better. A lot of time though we end up in mad lobbies against like golds and plats?? Feels broken in that regard. Can't rank up if you lose and when they have someone dropping 30-40 kills and we're all pretty close it just feels impossible. Anyway thanks for this post - felt like I was the only one 😂
A game children play is pushing lgbtq narrative so ofc they'll be mad
idk i dont like the styles and it looks boring
Because he can't leave without it
Bro never ever listen to what other people say I mean if it’s negative don’t let that shit get to you.
Had one with og breach and they picked all 5 flash agents ......it was hell we were getting pushed and killed every round but it was fun ngl.
Might be small sample size. I played a lot of games and went from bronze 3 to gold 3. I'm hard stuck there though and couldn't make it to platinum (just needed 2 wins, but kept going from 75->50->25->50->25->10->until I made it back to 55).

Games are terrible, people will afk preround consistently even if they're in a duo or trio. I think the most painful thing in lower elo is when your teammates get rushed really hard and 2 people die without any damage being done.

And suddenly you're on retake against equally skilled players, so it's painful.

But I just gotta improve at aiming and I'll be fine tbh.
I think my daughter, who is a child, might be significantly more mature than you are lmao. Nobody cares about your gaming experience, like at all. Your opinion on not having abilities in the game is still shit with all that experience, so doesn’t seem like it helped you out very much
Can't even read one sentence
I don't see my wonderful 1600x900
I went from valorant to playing stardew valley. ha
bro started typing just standing there.  I hope you won the round lol
I understand mid control is important and if teams pick optimal team comps like sage and cypher/kj then defense works better but I’m ranked most games people play who they want to play so sometimes you’re left SOL. 

Also I wasn’t saying the map itself is T sided but rather in uncoordinated ranked, if the offense just says “f it” and rushes A main the game can snowball pretty easily.
Ahhhh probably why I have 0 trophies because all I play is battle Royal
Honestly they probably are willing to take their time on this. If they get it right it will print money because the mobile market is so big.
Duelists tend to have the best movement abilities. There aren't many shield agents and none of them have the mobility you desire so I suggest picking up Jett, Raze or Neon to start out. Yoru could be viable but I wouldn't recommend playing him until you learn his tech, playstyle and how certain decisions are made when pro players play him. Not to mention you will most definitely flash your team and yourself
From a recent bug, the game automatically selects an area pin (Plankerton) that you've yet to visit when you select "Go to Map" (sometimes the "Play Now" button). You can return to the main area by selecting the Stonewood pin (not the one with the mohawk husk or the one with a cactus).
You can play any agent however you like as long as you are playing the game. Im obviously not including actual sabotage as part of the game. If you can't tell the difference between actual sabotage and someone who lurks with Reyna the you are exactly the kind of person I want to change the mind of because that distinction should be obvious.
Its literally one of the most basic concepts of this game, I don’t understand how gold and up don’t do this at all
Aye, but like the last bottle of rum there's no reason to stop hoping (looking at Arcane season 2 praying to riot gods)
Dont play right now unlock rank after 1 week i do this every episode i always get the rank I deserve my rank is diamond i tried to unlock rank in my alt id i got silver3💀
fns
Just keep trying I wasn't getting any chickens for 4 days then in 1 mission I managed to kill 20, you can try join a private mission & you don't see any chickens within 1 minute just quit & try another mission
They'll only flame me if they're lame and don't play along lol
OK there are 2 cypher trips and 2 kj mollies. they both can deny entry. both are pretty effective and are conducive to increasing kill potential. kj mollies work once, only last a few seconds and can even be run through like cypher trips used to be run through. although  being combined with an alarm bot can make them a deadly trap, the alarm bot makes a loud sound and gives a player enough time to react and destroy it. on the other hand, cypher trips work until they are broken, provide instant and exact player location and also stun, rearm very quickly as well, sound cue is very faint until you are right against them, and not to mention the fucking range on them!

 sure, you can shock them like kj mollies, or you can satchel over them, but many of the ways to break the trips can be difficult if they are of the unbreakable kind, the angle can be very tight. whereas unbreakable kj mollies are quite simple to shock and often take out the alarm bot as well. and if a duelist jumps a trip, they are now separated from their team and have to choose between breaking the trip or fighting the agents on site. I think the biggest issue is the max length on the trips. if this was shortened, they wouldnt be as nearly frustrating as they are now, but would still retain their usefulness.
Skye her flashes are just so good once you learn them
How do you differentiate between mid and okay? What are the perimeters established to what falls under mid or "okay"? Isn't mid thr same as "meh" which is aligned with "okay"? Doesn't seem to be very clear..
Buff omens tp so he can fill the dive entry position so players aren't forced to have a raze. Idk how you make jett balanced BCS she's just always gonna be goated on the op
This is silver in NA.

Silver on Europe, specifically on Frankfurt server are traumatising, I do have trauma cuz of them.
believe me there are 2 wolrds between us. I cant kill someone with 4 shots hit. I need like 2 full secs to get the head centered. I almost never survive that.  
i get outsprayed, i get out headshoted, i get out peaked...  
Im decent at flashing and gamesence. I can rotate and predict enemy movement but thats not worth anything if i die anyway when they swing arround the corner.
I believe I have 2 ps5 na invites left. Dm me for the link.
Meh fair enough
I get you, but it just hasn't been going up. Probably just me being silly. I started getting back into val and its hard popping off and seeing my negative teammate get more then me for the last week of games.
Nah, as a native English speaker, I get what he means. "Immortal 1 day ago" I initially tried reading as "Immortal 1" as in the rank. OP could've just said "yesterday" instead of "1 day ago." It's also a run-on sentence which doesn't help.
It’s not hundreds of hours.  Plus you can buy ranked ready accounts for $5.
You just picked up the game and already got an ace? I'm so sad but good job
id say its more than fine on simple agents like brim or most sentinels, people wont notice unless its an agent you need a lot of tech in like neon, raze skye etc.
There’re simply too many cheaters, even with a stricter anti-cheat compared to the global version, also the cheating industry as a huge grey zone was poisoning every competitive game for many years, along with free account registration, there’s simply nothing to lose with one cheater account got banned. One got banned, they just use another account. As for the false ban, from what I heard it’s a soft ban, like if you played too good for your rank and received too many reports, the system likely to flag you and give you a 8-24 hrs ban so you can’t play (which is annoying). Also most player who played on HK server or any SEA server, they will use “internet booster” which will cost slightly more, so it’s a slightly more complicated step for those cheaters, though it may sound like placebo but there may be less cheater who willing to play on global version.
To add: it’s not random, if it’s a fresh account, never played comp, they base it off of your unrated mmr (unless they’ve changed that since)
Idk what your rank is, but in gold there is very low chance anyone tells smoker anything. It's still press w click heads area. I think you got it reversed; one should learn basics of smoking and just do that until it's comfortable and intuitive, then learn some situational tricks that can be done with smokes, as there are many. IF someone actually takes over (or at least tries to) and requests smokes in specific places, then I agree, for the sake of team integrity and vibe NEVER argue, just drop smokes on pings and if it fails miserably (which is likely), then nt, and not your fault. 

  
Strenght of controllers is however ability to focus more on the strategy instead of blank stare at the crosshair (Reyna players cough cough) and enabling your teammates to at least try to coordinate some cooperation between random people. Any amount of cooperation is a huge difference maker in win chances.

  
OP I am genuinely breathless at your struggle, I have half your hs% and peaked g3 on Astra only, I attribute this somewhat laughable achivement to having decent comms and my dummy igling attempts, because my aim is barely bronze.
I play this game every 2 or 3 weeks. When i used to play it daily, it started feeling like shit. But if you take a break (2 or 3 weeks) , the game feels new again and is hella fun. I play with my friends every 2 or 3 weeks and it is very enjoyable 🙂🙂

P.S you can take shorter breaks ( i am forced to take such long breaks due to school work :((, but a few days' break should do the trick 😁)
I don't mind either, I think they're both good. Just wanted other opinions on what's nicer in general.
My second account just hit diamond, my main account was ascendant 2 last act, but is now plat2. I really believe the matchmaking in this game just sucks.
I was searching for a comment like this, it's so stupid. People partying can just relying on third party apps to call from there. Worst part of the update imo
This would be such a nice QoL update
Most sane Reyna main
I recognize someone maybe every 5 games or so, sometimes more.
Need insurance on your little resort vacation to sandals? Maybe don’t purchase vacations you can’t afford 😂
That’s a possibility but I’m hoping that based on the wording the devs have been using that they’ll release the agent sooner after the showcase
practice aim, 5stack.
I have spectrum classic, I drop a few for people to pick up on pistol. 

If you have a mic tho, or spam my name and question marks, I ain’t giving it to you. Use words. 

And also; if I’m playing a sent, or setting up as viper, don’t ask. I need time to get everything set, otherwise you’ll complain about it not being set up
I’m convinced they remove the RNG and make it so your aim and cross hair actually matter instead of your bullets going random places like in normal modes.
i must not be cultured
It will cycle around again. Unless she’s able to be fluxed. IDK though.
As a sova main seeing my teammates get kills because of my util makes me very happy.

Also when I hit 75 damage darts around corner.
I'd hardly call that doxxing lol. But THEY are the weirdo? My guy. .one click on your profile. Jesus. .
What hero were you running In my game it was a rtd there was a lynx and subzero zenith and another guy
Sunbeam and obsidian are crafting materials similar to malachite and silver etc, the more you progress then you can choose between two paths to go down
1) Go to settings. Click on the 2nd tab with the cog wheel for Game Settings.

2) On the Matchmaking Region. Change to a different region. Auto (doesn't always work well). If you know a time zone that is currently day time at the time you're currently on (use Google if you need help converting your time zone to another time zone) then change it to that region. Normally NA-West, NA-East, & Europe has been my go to. *Note: expect lags on certain servers.

3) Don't forget to Apply & Save the setting.

Start and read the Matchmaking queue on the bottom right while it searches.. if it doesn't work. Set repeat step 1-3 until you find a match with players. 
*Note: normally matches with better rewards will more likely have players.
*Note: be sure to make friends & add them.
My initial reaction to this nerf was that I was glad I was winding down my playing of this game so I don't have to deal with negative changes like this.

It's now literally been years since the spectral blade heavy attack has been bugged and I've given up on them ever fixing it. Yet they have the time to nerf Blakebeard's stach.
I have literally never done it in ranked other than once, which was only for two rounds and through no fault of my own (power outage). I take ranked more seriously than casual modes, which is as it should be...right? Since they clearly have separate ban timers for casual and comp, why not have them trigger separately too? 

This is like an NFL player getting suspended for leaving a friendly pickup basketball game early as if it was an actual pro football game. It makes no sense. You shouldn't be expected to take every sporting event as seriously as your actual competitive matches.
Add low_tide on discord and DM me once you get to gold solo queueing. I'm an immortal coach but as others have said, no point coaching until you've got a base skill to work on
Well, at the very least, if they also perform poorly with other guns, something cheaper allows them to buy better for their team (considering they'd perform poorly regardless).

The problem with that is volume of gunfights that I get. In a Deathmatch or TDM I could take a gunfight every ten seconds or so, and I can practice pistols or a particular gun for several if I wanted to. In comp, losing a gunfight or even just being in the wrong part of the map means I get to essentially sit out of the game for thirty seconds to two minutes, which is far less efficient in the long run, and in most round buying a Deag or Marshall is an objectively terrible idea.
Don't recycle survivors, heroes, or defenders until way later in the game.
Why mad lol?
Anything below immortal is low elo
I am not sure what your playstyle is but a common mistake many duelist players make is not waiting for utility from supports, I ain't a high elo player but recently playing a game with two plats, I saw the problem most Dualist have, they don't wait for the support, obviously we have to provide support as soon as possible, but we can't do that if the Raze just satchels to the back of site while we all are getting fired at and utility dumped from 1000 different angles.

Happened in a game on Ascent where the Raze was constantly just pushing the site without any utility now she was the highest ranked player we had and definitely was amazing at Aim, but because she wasn't wating for any support and pushing the site while we have to push behind her in a space where enemies can be anywhere.

Wait for a flash to come so that enemies aren't able to just shoot you in a second, and wait for the smokes to recharge no point in running it down and exposing yourself to unnecessary angles, without info.

Other than that don't worry about kills as long as you are able to just generate the chaos for the enemies you are making sure your team is winning.
thank you we finished it on our first try
>So my theory is that to solo-queue your way out of lower ELO, you just need to be able to carry. Straight up.

Yup. Good teamplay is useless if your teammates don't know what they are doing. Game sense is useless if your enemies actions are random and unexplainable. 

If you were playing soccer or basketball, it wouldn't make a lot of sense to practice complicated plays when you and your teammates struggled to pass and shoot consistently. Even if you had the play down perfect, if you can't execute it successfully most of the time, you wasted your effort. You'd have done better drilling fundamentals.

Valorant is closer to a physical sport than something like chess. It's not useful to focus on strategy until you have the fundamental skills down.
Does this have anything to do with FTC lawsuit?

'' hello team ''
Toxicity is very common in games with a competitive nature. Valorant specifically and free games in general have more toxic players for some reason for guys aswell, about half my games have at least one inmature person, people on the internet insult more because there are no real repercussions, you dont know each other and you dont really think there is a person behind and we are all used to being insulted so its kind of a gaming normality. However, I have noticed a lot of misoginy in the playerbase playing with my girl (and female friends) or watching her play, sometimes people would go like girl gg in chat or insult so she rarely ever talks in team vc, doesn't want a nametag that gives out her gender (she is a really sensible person) stereotypes do a lot of bad. 

It is not normal, but girls do have a higher chance (around 60% in our experience) of being object of toxicity, and sadly "motives". There is still friendly people out there trying to win and have a good time, so maybe try and talk for info and greetings/have a chat and if someone goes unga bunga, instamute and report.

Good luck!
I wish they’d update the gun buddies to match the skin colors (Araxys please)
What’s your tracker?
Celeste is good yea

You misunderstood: there are more bronzes because people get carried OUT of iron, not the opposite
when we heading to Hexylvania? :)
I mean, I don't see why it really matters?

If it matters to you, huge, that's awesome.

If it doesn't matter to someone else, who cares? lol

If this matters to you, and other people saying they don't care is hurting your excitement or enjoyment, who cares about them? Enjoy it anyway.

I feel like it's similar to an OG Halo player asking an OG PS3 CoD player if they're excited about Halo 3, then being surprised and hurt when the CoD player says they don't care. If they don't care for it, they don't care for it. That doesn't mean you can't be hyped about Halo 3 anyway.

People nowadays can't just enjoy things unless everyone else also enjoys it.

Obviously, there are the toxic ones, but there's always going to be toxic people. There's a very simple way to deal with that, too:
"(I) Nobody cares."
"Cool, anyways..." and move on to people who do care.
You're just letting a bunch of random people shit over your hype and enjoyment for no real reason.
yeah releasing nature locked guns in a fire season wasn’t the smartest play

Yeah. All the pellets land at the same time so it blocks all of them. It soft counters shorty because one blast won't always kill. Judge is dependent on if the iso can react and aim. Shotguns are not the answer sadly.
I mean it is entirely based on what you want to do with the game tbh. If you want to continuously improve and be mildly competitive about it, go for it. If you're just there for the fun, you can always try it and then stop playing it if that level of competitiveness isn't what you're seeking in a game just for fun. Just don't let anyone else tell you what to do and feel pressured into it. At the end of the day (and I do not mean this in a mean way AT ALL) you likely won't be good enough to go pro or anything, so just do what seems fun or is fun :)
Forgot to mention that there was no proper knife fight, it was all just from lurks and positioning
You are just bad. Viper needed nerfs. I am a Viper main who will be fine that my agent is not now overpowered as fuck. Get good.

If I’m bronze 2 and don’t beat the gold 1 then I don’t deserve bronze 3?
And dont worry, i think average diamond player has around 1k games, and i have played around 900 so far in lifetime so yea, you will aurely climb. Besides, someone has to be on the bottom of the leaderboard, thats the whole point of leaderboard. So glhf!
actually there is an even older build from 2011 we got our hands on, but the archive isnt public to this day.
you need to look at the center of where the seize hit to see if someone got affected. then you can see the general direction of the people hit
Forget this. Clearly the guy can work with fundamentals first. He’s spraying everywhere.
Starts with 2-3 bullet bursts. 
Why are people telling him to run when he needs to learn how to walk
Being wrong on a call you made repeatedly while dead is deserving of being told to shut up
What do you define as medium elo. As a plat-diamond player I don’t see Chamber having the kind of impact you’re describing
Tenz changes his constantly and that's really only something a few people like him can do. I think right now he actually plays on a low sens.

Tenz is fun to watch, but I wouldn't follow his "routine" for aiming haha. He switches up sens and mice way too often.
Now I am actually just going to be harsher. This has had the opposite effect.
I understand the whole okay a downshift is gonna happen thing but still am a bit confused about the system tho, I peaked p1 and deranked to g3 last week of the act after multiple weeks of hardstuck at p1. Got placed s2 climbed to g2 yada yada but now im consistently seeing one ep 8 diamond gun buddy in my lobbies per day at gold?
This is so weird, I've had the opposite experience. People are usually chill and nice, but I only play comp/TDM so maybe unrated is different
[removed]
Not find in inventory
I post in tiktok comments and stuff man. Or discord groups. It's a site, not an app
because sometimes OP is a smurf who goes into lower lobbies to get those clips. thats why
a lot of players dont know how to change playstyles based on map and also dont want to put in genuine effort to change how they approach problems
those are truffles
if he hits radiant on raze = he’s a radiant player,
if he doesn’t = he was never a radiant player and lied about it to build his brand.
Really this all depends on how the next month or two goes for him.
That voice while inspecting
Right. It’s just someone being dumb on a video game.
Sage mommy
Whats your sens? KAST looks like you are not playing enough with your team so that they can trade you.
Rip
So would this only hold up so long as there are more devs than tasks to be complete then? 

Also in this specific case where we’re talking about bug fixes, would more people doing QA or debugging have the same effect as more people on the development side?
yep. that guy is goated. quick question- who is the best cypher out of these 3? acre, dinghy and peak. (except you mr goat sir.(btw i REALLY admire you. you're the reason im a cypher main now. the kills are so satisfying and it makes me overjoyed to watch enemies get tilted and blindly run into site again. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY G))
in my experience, sage topfraggers are most likely smurfs
Vandal:

1. Kuronami (White)
2. Primodium (Blue)
3. RGX (Yellow)

Phantom:

1. Recon (Green)
2. Champions
3. Spectrum
Nope.obviously the correct answer is the black market butterfly

But its your mulah so you do you

Opp voice line- My territory my rules. I have them now 

Team mate voice line - Pull them to their grave. Nothing there.
Ah, it has been a while, I must have forgotten 👍

Prime in csgo didn't fix cheaters or smurfs. What makes you think phone number verification will fix that. There are hundreds of sites where you can just buy a number for less than $5
they didn’t blame their teammates. “me and my team”
You need to either master Reyna or the Operator gun to dig yourself out.
it was the coping part lmao
just spend this time learning the game, don't worry about winning. when ranked comes out these people will learn or get filtered to the bottom.  I felt the same way in the PC beta but I should've been focused on having a good time and learning (I was Iron 1 in the PC beta ranked).
my point is its good he plays less than me because im negative winrate w alot of games.
I wouldn't buy it if it came into my shop. I started episode 1 act 2 so I missed the first battlepass and cry bc no dot.exe skins for me

That's still a good living mansion tbh
He's sentinel
The original champions vandal badly needs an update, it looks really pixelated.
It is obviously a wall bang 🙄
Great list

Hurts to see so many good/helpful bugs there, but ik, bug is bug...
Same. I got the ultimate too. I wouldn't have spent the money if it was now, but I was in love with the game back then. No regerts lol

... I'm still in love with it now. It's just different. Back then I thought the story would be finished and the devs wouldn't leave us behind.
"new content"
Just play? It’s just a game, not a school presentation. You don’t have ranked anxiety, you’re afraid of being placed in lower ranks and being perceived as “garbage” by other players. Not saying you don’t have anxiety, but you’re misplacing the reason of your uneasiness. Learn how to ignore people who you’ll never queue into again or people you’ll never read another comment from again, or just queue unrated and swift. That’s not something we can help you do. Play the game mode that you can actually have fun in.
Rocket missile registration is bad sometimes, I even dodged a few from enemy razes, thinking that I might die!
Does the durability bonus stack if you have multiple matching survivors or is it just a one time thing?
certainly not. You have the power to alter it but you refuse to do so.
I mean it’s easier to go from silver to diamond then immortal to radiant
I guess... I'm only barely Asc but being Cypher or Viper helps me direct traffic a lot.
they wont lmao
Nah
“His”
Known bug happening to lots of users on PC. It’s on the list of many many things they’ve broken in Fortnite and FortniteBR at the moment. Every platform seems to have unique bugs too, so it may take a bit to fix.
Pls do me🙏
Duelist makes me think much deeper on what I’m doing and why I do it. Also makes me 10x as aggressive for some reason.
still not good huh
thanks for answering
Well the only thing I can recommend for now is just wait and try again until the issue is resolved and if it doesn't, go seek help at Microsoft support.  
I wish you the best of luck at getting your account back! If your locker is still empty after logging into Microsoft, Epic Support is very likely to help you further.
The real damage is the amount of discord notifications you're getting💀😭
he said he was plat thats why i said that but you are right.
i tried moving my monitor closer to supposedly see better because pros do it and it just made me dizzy 😔
you got this man! i hope you win
i hit bronze 1 finally took a year tho
can you post your tracker? HS% won’t matter if you still have a low KD
As a silver player, I am indeed stupid
hehe
Congratulations
Santa’s lil helper? I enjoy using it but u might not
It's sad how fast they are to fix particular things that become "abusive" rather than fix actual in game problems
Ok I’ll move him up one
Wait I think I was the opponent skye
The thing that makes yoru rn very good is that cypher is meta and yoru has a good kit vs him

Other than razes ult maybe having more area than her nade, I think they are both pretty fine atm
I play with my comms muted on Mumbai server. Getting Intel from teammates from pinging and mini map indications. When I started playing valo I used to talk to people but 8 out of 10 times I just come across trash talkers. So I just muted it.
Also another reason your argument is utter nonsense is that I get Match MvP 80% of the games I lose. Match, not even team.
….. then you’ve won friend 
…..
I swear these new players don't understand the game. Then post garbage without any evidence.
bro just watch this video and you will be happy I promise  https://shrinkme.us/3gu5Fl
it is very much. STW player count spikes at vbuck alerts because of the founders that have access to it, but they arent the majority and thus dont make much of a difference.

It's fundamentally different to why Festival player count spikes, Festival and BR is a much closer comparison than to Festival and STW.
Switch lotus for bind, and I agree
Kay/o, omen, chamber (,sort of)
These wankers were trully a menace.
Same with cypher cages
She’s really good. You should use her ult when 1. Taking a site on offense 2. Retaking a site on defense or 3. Defending a retake on offense. Her ult is best when the enemy are pushing in or close. They shouldn’t have time to shoot the dogs because they are exposing themselves to get to site, are being affected by your other teammates utility, or you swing them when they try to shoot.
Any console 'pro' regardless of their actual skill will get clowned on by the community lmfao
I’m ascendant on initiator  and control but I Smurf to practice duelists and sentinels not tryna grief my higher rank boys with bronze ability placements🫡
Ur dogshit lmao
It’s called counter strafing. Basically you burst shoot and move. You don’t want to pull down when shooting because you’ll have to commit to the fight. This makes it harder for you to hit and it resets your shot/recoil.
Yeah i also have an missing emote
you're focusing on the number of kills too much on the leaderboard. don't blame your teammates. as a deulist you got 3 entry kills in 39 frags, which is low. you can't change what your teammates do, so focus on yourself.
So are the Jett and sage couples
Early success makes me play more reckless which makes me not do as well as I did early.
While the report feature exists, people still are toxic to each other because they know that even if they get hit with punishments, the punishments are small enough that they don't care. It doesn't matter if they get hit with a 3 day competitive ban if they can hop on an alt and keep being toxic there.
Wait what happend with Sinatra? I forgot all the overwatch drama since I quit
Got some error code 404 😔😔
You’ve played valorant and are willingly inviting another person to join the plague? Where are your morals op
If you are both gold why not just play comp?

Here is a fact you have to accept the entire concept of game modes is complete horse shit, competitive modes have become casual, unranked modes have become whatever the hell and game devs cant get any of this right. 

The way I see it since you are both gold you should both just queue into competitive because competitive is now casual. 

Another option is just tell her that you 2 are going to have some fun trolling and throwing for 20 or so matches to drive your MMR down in unrated. 

Also pro tip don't do anything competitive with a girlfriend or family its just a horrible idea.
There might unironically be 8000 games with better lore lmao. Could be the most braindead reason to play valorant
I believe not. Last time it happened to it was Sunset.
Gaia
Me toon
Haven't got those yet
same
Yeah no problem if I get selected I’ll send you a code and hopefully you do the same for me
I dont grind PWO at all, could not care less about it
Same. I swear it must be a regional thing.
I just want to lose lotus or breeze :(
This question is asked every day here. How is it not natural for people to hover over the header in a table to check if there aren't some more information? Don't you have a mouse? Hover over the ACS header and you'll see the formula.
Prime Karambit 2.0 with opening animation is one of the cleanest knives in the game. RGX skins are overrated. 2023 Champions Knife is clean and actually good.
Oh man, it's you who is not able to understand the hypothesis I just told you about the game changes. You just went straight to argue. It's your choice nothing can be done.
Is this a new heroe for stw 😂
so that’s why my golds skyrocketed recently
Yeah so, it good that operator isn't as good anymore against one agent, for example chambers ult he can kill people one shot iso makes chamber have to take a very risky duel shooting two times or have to tp away
What does it do though?
Me when I’m in a “who’s the most mentally ill” and my opponent is u/Culexius bringing up MK in a valorant subreddit
They were before xray tickets were implemented. Can confirm that myself, I usee to farm them on multiple alts with Xbox's gamesharing feature. Only reason one of them has founders status now is because I bought it when Epic changed that.
The first is only for clowning on them for being toxic, not because they deserve a second chance. So it’s more like 1.5
No comms happen even in radiant. However, it is less likely to happen for sure.
I HATE HOW THEY HAVE DAMN NEAR GIVEN UP ON SUCH AN AMAZINGLY ENJOYABLE GAMEMODE.
Yeah true but he’s still gonna annoying until the console nerf happens
That’s the whole point of it being common
you can only use kingdom credits after the 28 day period for unlocking him with exp is over, val points do work from day one tho
How do you do this? What client?
the pros usually play viper, sova, kayo, cypher and jett. i feel like viper is enough as smokes, but u can do viper + harbor so when viper runs out of fuel, harbor can put his wall.
Well I don't care about playing unrated on my main but what I do care about is playing with friends and at least one of them doesn't wanna play when I'm on my main.
Spectrum classic is probably the best gun for the spectrum bundle. I have both the classic and phantom, finisher is so nice too, legit makes a dance floor on the enemy and make me so happy. Even if I loose to an enemy with a spectrum skin I still dance in my chair
The fire rate is insane. I supercharged my schematic.
I’m here to prove you wrong.
If we're not counting bugs (like Cypher cam w/ sheriff) or beta agents (Raze double nade):

\- Reyna on release had up to 4 charges of dismiss/heal

\- Jett on release, dash anytime, 3 smokes/2 updraft, right click refresh ult

\- Chamber on release with 2 infinite range trips, 100 credit headhunter, better ultimate

\- either Astra on release with 5 stars OR Viper, after the decay buff but before the fuel nerf

\- KAY/O after his right click flash got buffed was kind of a sleeper for a while
well that's make sense, I guess I have been -unknowingly- abusing this bug too, and they fixed it in the latest patch.

Thanks for the input.
such a cool guy, i bet everyone loves you and you are a fun guy :)

Removing 4 stacks was the worst decision possible.
as much as those skillcapped youtube videos keep repeating the same shit it really works, crosshair placement/aim training/positioning is key to get out of low elo
Ive literally proved that it is
Nah bro my Laptop dies with 8gb ram.
- Add choice in settings to turn off squat and slide.
- get rid of X (on Xbox)  button auto placing last trap. It's also the button to go to trap menu.
- fix class icon of transfers so that it actually shows what class your teammate is.  Actually, add text showing what everyone's main hero is.
Lmao! Still way better than your humour! Keep blabbering, I don't want to invest my time on a nobody on the internet. Peace out!
What's wrong with the classic skin and the sheriff skin?
Is there aim assist?

Where?
nah fr cuz "its too op" but then Reyna pulls up practically indestructible??? Only reason i played sage over sky was cuz i could heal myself but i mean at this point i might as well play sky. but they went a buffed her fricken blinds to so they dont even rlly blind -\_-

depends on the skin of course. if its expensive with a lot of work put into it i still wont buy it if its not my style. i dont see myself spending more than 30 vp on a single skin though.
That hand melee weapon you get from beating msk.

Or just bind scroll to knife and gun?
difficult to understand your question. you should ONLY shoot when you are completely standing still, you may strafe before and after.

  
if you encounter an enemy, should you instantly shoot ? or strafe first ? its completely situational.
I think I spent more than $4000 in skins. It’s bad lol. I slowed down in buying. I’ve been playing since beta.
She’s quite good on bind for taking showers control imo. I see her every now and then in ascendant. Def see astra less.
Y but it should be punished hard.
It's literally just as good to clarify you know there's more chances and stick your guns. If they weren't lying and they were just wrong, there isn't a problem. If they WERE lying, you still stuck your guns and drove home on the point 


I'd there's circumstances you don't know about, the kid has a chance to explain what they are. None of its hard, and you can always give ultimatum if you're not sure a kid won't take an hour and a half of game time they don't need if it means the time without playing resets after
Ohr but she is very good for msk
Idk usually that’s a crosshair placement or movement issue, try getting some coaching maybe.
I don't lmfao
Saw a guy named JFK peek an op lmfao
Keep queuing with Manas Mi. You have an 80% win rate together
In lower ranks mostly individual performance. The system always takes into account your MMR compared to your enemies, so if you play against lower MMR players, it will expect you to perform well and give you less average +RR for winnin with average KDA. If you win and perform well against higher MMR enemies you get bonus RR. Dia/Asc+ rounds won start weighing more than individual performance (unless u pop off hard)
I would gladly take one of your hands if you have no use for them
i have no clue why you're downvoted. people cry against shotgun players (who sometimes camp in their smokes) or odin spammers. those are guns and there's nothing wrong with using them. if you can't play against them, get better.
for endurance?

husks are only going to be attacking from very specific directions. you really only need to build defenses in those directions

or are you just talking general atlas defense builds? 

i prefer the pyramid with the corners made into squares so it funnels all the husks into the 4 cardinal directions and you can just trap those 4 holes

but as stw goes. a large majority of all this is entirely personal preference
Lmao Good thing, I put the disclaimer at the beginning. I play rarely to begin with so yea thanks for the input
The question should be 'how micro does the penis has to be for someone to smurf?'
Yeah hahahahhaahah
It depends on the distance and the gun really. If you are very close for instance you should definitely run and gun. Woohojin, as always, provides some good material on [that](https://youtu.be/SI7yUp67KT8?si=ZQB54_5t_U3Kc11_).
Prime and prelude for vandal and recon for phantom
I know everyone have said this. KJ's ult is one of the best ults, if placed properly. I am surprised that no-one has mentioned this, I also like Omen's ult. It can sometimes be predictable but overall it's a fun ult.
[removed]
He needs 3 if he's putting those trips like that.
That… makes sense
yeah it’s today at some point
I only ever get headshots with phantom and then die it feels like
I’ve learned that typically you want to go for an EDPI of about 280. Then, you divide that by your actual DPI to get you’re ideal sens. 

280 / 800 is 0.35. I personally use 0.375 on 800 DPI for a tad bit more speed. So yours is about double what it should be. If you’re struggling with accuracy or hitting shots but still want more speed I’d recommend 0.45 or something a little higher. That way your still higher than the sens you should be at while still being more accurate and controlled than the one your currently at (that is, if you’re struggling of course) 

Hope this helps
Not for judge tho
I used to use it to lag homies ps4
Here comes the "The bronze and plats are smurfs!! They're smurfing in TDM! Stop bullying me because i know i deserve a higher rank if these smurfs would stop sabotaging me!"

God, I'm so tired of these posts.
play the game more, also where is your corsshair
Right after rank reset I dropped five kills for three games in a row lmao
Nah not really, i cant even remember when I lost a 160,...
I’m usually high plat low Diamond while they’re bronze.
For Stonewood and Plankerton no,  because the traps are capped at lower lv level, Canny traps are lv 116 so that's up to you,  i use 144's in Canny and Twine.  Usually when ppl say AFK its kinda not truly AFK it means all the normal waves are AFK which is 90% of it .

Each Endurance has different challenge waves like UFO , Tornado, Space rocks, and Mini boss waves you need to deal with, some of these could cause you to fail and for example if you don't shoot down the UFO's.

If you run a full Survivor Durability loadout you can make it to wave lv 30, i personally like my trap damage and i have to replace some tire drop traps at wave 25-26
HONESTLY THO???? I have to restart my laptop every time i load up val and there’s always like 1/3 chance of crashing?!!! it happens to other people i know too it’s so weird
You should also find a great player that mains on agent. Judgement is  fantastic if you want to main KAY/O
Were you the Reyna last week? I had that exact moment lol. We tried to explain which button to use, but probably the key binding was wrong.
no way my man got THAT much epic perk up 🤤🤤
funny enough, I report all smurfs, even when their on my team, I know it does nothing but can't hurt to do it lol
We did got one [Player Card teaser](https://www.gameort.com/2023/12/next-valorant-agent-25-controller-smokedancer-teaser-abilities-nationality.html) in EP 8 Act 1 Battle Pass.
I wouldn’t know about ventures quest since I’ve never participated in any of them. Usually though, from story missions, quest thing to search or interact will be there regardless and cannot be destroyed whether someone has interacted with it or not. Believe that stuff is client side. I’ve definitely played my fair share of solo missions and some searchables appeared as if they’ve been searched but yet I hadn’t done so.
I just checked that post and i was one of the people who upvoted it.

But your comment was about prerelease. After release (until the nerf) there was a ton of post spammed in here complaining about how aggresive he was, it wasnt fitting to a sentinel, he aggro picked similar to a duelist. And they were right, his teleportation ability was what made him a pseudo duelist. This was literally the reasoning for removal of 2 teleporters. He was a better duelist than yoru back then.
It's just basically a copy of vertigo from CS, which is also considered a troll map so yeah, it's a troll map
Yoooo i am a stw youtuber (currently 10k) I would like to know if you still have it cause I would like to see it in game. **So please check your Reddit DMS**

That’s awesome, do you guys play ranked? If so what ranks are you guys?
mmkaay
guys please just look at the other reply

this guy just replied to the wrong comment
Should anyone tell you how to spend your disposable income? Nope.
every sova main’s wet dream.
The amount of times that I see people die because they thought they would shave 2 secs off of a rotate in silver is laughable. Only run with knife when you KNOW where the remaining enemies are and only then when you RECENTLY know where they are.
play private matches, it's not that hard if your IQ is above 30
So teams will just stop doing that or theyll only buy a deagle and no armour.
Or, at least, try lowering the settings.

But this will only help as long as the HW isnt too old (my 950m with 2GB is kinda near the low end, i guess.)
1200 dpi. 2.63. Yes it’s very specific. It’s the same sense as Apex as it helps me track people better. Don’t follow other people’s sense find your own
That's what you got out of what I said?  What a weird thing to be defensive about.
I stopped playing ranked a few months ago, peaked Asc. I only play with my friends now whenever they're on and it's way more fun that way. Solo queue is the worst.

I was going to climb my way to Immo 1 at least, but it took too much of my life and I'm much happier now :)
iso got done dirty for cheap 🗿
Thanks :)
Me honestly I think this is being taken a bit too seriously. It is just a pixelated game BUT due to his actions he’s gotten to top with a foul advantage and preventing others with true higher credentials from getting the deserved spotlight they worked for and deserve. In the end though the community did appreciate him and a content creator is more than just the gameplay skill they provide. But as a coach this does hurt his credentials and reputation. Still just a game though lol.
They've literally increased the amount of rewards?
People who lock sage as a sentinal instead of cypher , kj , deadlock and chamber.
Only new players will have this experience as a veteran myself in Valorant I can assure you playing smokes isn’t boring. Most people know this but still will complain about shit they think is easy. I peaked ascendant 2 by playing 95% of my games as a controller main. Trust me I would be immortal 1 or 2 if the rank system wasn’t broken right now.

So if you gonna try insta lock Omen or Clove just use your abilities to help your team not to frag out because that isn’t your job.
In my ranked games teammates will encourage you to hunt for the final kill if you got a 4k and it's like 5v1

sometimes, people will apologize when stealing your ace without noticing

the only time where people just steal your ace is when you got a 4k but the round is still like 2v1 and you gotta guarantee the win
This one belongs to r/fortniteBR, but I agree.
I’m not toxic and I’m not blaming anybody so idk why you would assume both of those things. It’s you a lot of these other commenters that are the ones being toxic and give Val the reputation for being toxic. 

On the contrary, it’s clear I’ve accepted that I’m average at this game and am encouraging people to have fun and not worry about their rank.
Yeah, you will get it even if you derank. So keep grinding!
I dont get what you mean by where in the map?
On pc, this happens when your GPU is about to die, so maybe there’s something wrong with your phones CPU
Nah u had a good crosshair placement
Voice chat is now also starting to do a good job of insta-banning people. Had an edgy teenager dropping the hard R in voice and got banned as soon as I hit the report button. Then we all proceeded to make fun of him the entire match while he couldn’t respond. *chefs kiss*
I had a gekko ult into tp and I went in after, I thought thrash detained faster than she did so I ended up being detained with the enemy in the tp and they ended up killing me. It was both funny and tragic lol
What a Chad, really sick move!
Surrendering and remaking is another feature where I asking myself "Is league and valo really from the same company"? It's so funny how different this two games works while they are from the same company. Seems like Valo didn't use what league already learned in it lifetime xD
Why is there no Raze?!
how unhealthy is it exactly? 

Yesterday I had a ranked match with my friend (both gold) and we get peak immortal 3 Jett in our team vs diamonds and plats. 3 duelists. All game our immortal 3 Jett can barely shoot and apparently he was high. Yep he was high, when our neon hears this he immediately goes afk. So here I am me and my friend both gold in a 3v5 against diamonds and plats
.... i should've expected that formatting. Copied text for easier reading:

I've been playing ranked mostly in a three stack with objectively better players (kills, assists, util usage) which both had the same rank. But then I get a double rank up to my personal best rank?   
From what I've seen double rank-ups happen when hidden mmr is three ranks greater than actual rank, but how would that be the case if gold 1 is my highest rank reached?   
  
(besides the match mvp i've been bottom half of the leaderboard)
That's because you seem to thinks strafing is only left and right
Right between the eyes
yeah this clip was yesterday after just getting back into the game
Lol I’ve been playing since closed private beta and I’m bronze 2 with like 1500 hours😂 Val is pain…….
Beta avalanche 😅
The reason why people don't really talk about the premium skin pricing is that the skins don't give you any advantage, the game is 100% free to play, and if you are on a budget, the battle passes offer great value.
Thanks for the response, I figured I'd ask since I know League and CS2 have it, here's to it being added someday!
Habit, island, zone, whatever your preference of words is.
Everything you said was probably correct, but AI can absolutely accommodate for all of the things listed and most you didn’t list.
Younger me would've queued. Older me just stops.
SUBROZA, IS THAT YOU?
Rgx is solid
Is this “BluGlownium”?
I played against a dad + kid in an enemy team. It was cute and every time the dad got a kill the kid would type THATS MY DAD.  Wholesome stuff.

As others have said, there are a few ways to help you farm up materials. One thing you might want to try is having a melee build as well if you are having issues with ammo so you can do some encampment missions for quick fights and resources. There is also the missions for doing resource farming. Personally, I try to go for like a cat 4 storm and set it to private so I can farm for as long as I want. If you need specific stuff, make sure you find a good zone for each thing, like not going into the desert to find mechanical parts and nuts and bolts kind of items. Need herbs? Forest areas are great. Deserts are perfect for any rock related items, but can be done in plains decently. Industrial zones are usually best for most machinery items with cities and suburbs being close together after. And as stated by others, the hero loadout can do wonders for improving how quickly you can gain mats. 

If you are having issues with space in your bag, how many weapons are you carrying? Too many of them can really cut back on the number of stacks of mats you can carry as well. As long as you have the schematic and mats, you can craft weapons on the go. I not saying that you do, but I have seen people just carry several copies of the exact same gun and waste tons of space because they do this for several weapons.

 Also, you can store more in your home base storage, so if you get a decent amount built up for your say nuts and bolts, you can keep some there so you don't have to farm them up immediately in between finding decent farming conditions.
Go Frankfurt Server much more international.
1 to 7 got banned, they're gonna start streaming on this one lol https://www.twitch.tv/ttenz8
I think that type of toxicity is mostly in low. The higher you go the less toxic it gets (but also more sweaty). Everyone has a big ego in lower ranks and think they are better than everyone when they are equally as bad. I have seen this when I was playing with my friend on a silver alt account and nearly every game had atleast one person flaming the team
That is not too long haha, get out of here with your hardstuck claims 😤
This is the exact reason I stopped player Sage. Most players are ungrateful when you play Sage. No matter how much you contribute to the team, they still see you as inferior. And whenever you topfrag they actually hate you more and find excuses to disrespect you, like typing in all chat "how sage get kills I never know".  


I am guessing this is a psychological thing many kids and adults alike have with the caring person type. Maybe stemming from their hate for their own mothers, because she didn't buy the super expensive toy they wanted when they were 5.  


"cause the toxic people are too busy screaming in every comp game to be on reddit"  
I don't agree with this one, reddit is filled with GenZ NPCs who just repeat what they were taught by those in power. They viciously attack anyone who doesn't go by the status quo, as was the reddit karma/vote system was designed to be.
Yep feels like the bundle is being carried by that finisher. Also I don't see why they're pumping sheriff skins so much. We just had neofrontier and haven't had a classic in so long.

just kill her bro
its the watermark on the top left ?

Fade change makes sense, people were able to basically use it like a pop flash to entry for themselves. They would fire it around a corner and immediately swing with it. That's not rhw intended behavior for an initiator and as such nerf made Sense.
Especially with that loud ass sound
groot vandal
i haven’t ever noticed a difference.
Dia here, actually have a useful comp by having initiators (or kj/raze) to break them 🤷‍♂️. Maybe even kayo so you can full rush with no util to stop you
I've got the same bug
User Interface has nothing to do with other Bug fixes. But yah wey need other Bugs fixes too.
yea im so pressed…you got me

just correct misinformation you were giving OP because you clearly don’t know what ur talking about
27.


I play like 1 ranked game a day
Just search chests in a 34+ zone or higher
Dropping things is entirely up to you so if you drop it and someone take it there’s nothing you can do

Scammers will continue to scam and dumb kids will fall for it

We don’t call it scamwood for no reason
Just like in the LEGO mode... yay for features flying over... NOT!
You are full of excuses. Sorry mate
not new (:
If they give Phoenix or clove that voice line I’ll riot
[removed]
Nothing like watching someone crawl to the site the longest way possible, panic when the spike is already too late to defuse and get tapped at first contact and hand the enemy a free vandal.
na bro im just different
Yea but you can win in Overwatch with less mechanical skill if you’re smart and have teamwork. In Valorant you can be smart and have good teamwork but all that does is make your gunfight more favorable you still have to hit the shots whereas if im playing mercy all of my impactful plays are decisions and I shoot my gun once in a blue moon
then what is the difference between a duelist and everyone elses job while taking site? at that point it just becomes "character best at winning aim fights"
Hey, current Asc1 and last act Asc3 here. Your stats seem fine so i dont think any aim tips are needed for now. I think the biggest tip I could think of is pattern recognition and taking smart fights.
Pattern recognition is a big part of developing good game sense. Us as humans have certain tendencies and patterns in everything we do. So you can analyse how the enemy team is playing and pay attention to their setups and tendencies.
This way you can start expecting and coordinating hits better, helping you and your team win more fights and more games.
AHHAHA I know, but I been using 27” from almost 2 years
Yes replays are difficult to build for a game that wasn't initially created with replays in mind, and therefore expensive. But to imply that riot can't afford it because valorant is F2P is absurd, not to mention you're pulling 75% out of your ass because at least anecdotally everyone I see in all my games have skins.
I had a criteria of util I wanted in a character which was movement and a flash, so I picked Yoru. I also really like Steve Blum so that’s why I main brim for smokes.
16 wins, happened to me when I had just bought my current mouse and keyboard and then I was in too high elo lobbies to the point I started bot fragging every game, I went from silver 1 to plat 3 back to gold 3, but I was playing diamond/asc in plat 3
And this is what I’ve been trying to say when no proven statistics favour a side we use common sense with the use of other relational data

It's best to use metal unless the mission has the metal corrosion modifier or lightning (yellow) enemies.

If you get the xenon bow you can shoot survivors off cars, and since the car isn't destroyed they can't take damage. It's like forcing them to rocket ride. Same can be done with players.

Upgrade your survivors.
Just make it blue and call it a Mist Monster.
Bro is cooking absolutely nothing.
I’m so sad they didn’t make a ghost variant. I think it would have fit so well.

You could sell her default first star after you place it and take it back giving you an extra 150 creds
On defense? nothing wrong with it at all. On attack? unless your doing it legit every single round to condition the enemy (and think you can take the other site without the viper wall, this is why duel controller is nice) then it can be a good way to get the enemy to rotate before the round even starts.
That was because I had to prove to people I wasn’t lying when I said I emptied the clip but the game didn’t register it when the Cypher bug was out (amongst other reasons lol)
Clash of clans when world chat still exists be like :
I'm definitely addicted to the game and I actually don't like it as much as I play it. I would play it once a week if I wasn't addicted, but now play every day, get onetapped every round and onto the next game to get onetapped every round. I hate how the game is really all about the HS.
ITS ON YOUR SCREEN MAN.
I saw that video on skillcapped your talking about right?[This right?](https://youtu.be/MX5dS4B4tB8?si=bV7TnbGX9z4sYqIa)
Frenzy and stinger are the worst.
You can also use sova drone to find trips
Will it work for xbox
[removed]
Can you give me a reason as to why it's not?
It's not good or bad in principle, it's just another tool. I crouched tons and I climbed two accounts from placements to ascendent.
Ok, what's your solution? It's easy to notice the problem, but solutions are often times not so obvious. So, what would you propose Riot do?
make an image post n drag n drop it into there, must be longer than 15 seconds
As a female, i usually mute them straightaway if they start acting weird/toxic. Sorry you had to experience that, this game has a lot of no-life imbeciles that makes the game not enjoyable.
cs2 is harder to master, and most people saying otherwise haven't played it for more than a few hours.
That's such a shitty take on the problem. There's people that will never climb above gold, and silver. People that work, have families, and other much more important stuff going on their lives, to take time to improve in a game that should be just a fun casual time when you are below certain ranks.

Sure, there's sweaty people like me and others that one week in the game are already memorizing or writing notes about lineups, and take 30+ minutes of every gaming session and use to train strafing, one taps, micro adjustment, tracking. But the game shouldn't be okay to only these people.

The game should be specially free of smurfs in the lower ranks, where people only want to have fun or are just getting started in the game.
> she got to dia and asc in like 2 weeks  

And then everyone clapped. You gotta use less extreme examples for lies bro. Either increase the timeframe of when she climbed to those ranks or lower the rank she climbed to lower than dia and asc from bronze. Like say from gold to diamond or something.

it’s just a visual glitch, if you restart fortnite it will update your rank. also this is the wrong subreddit you’re looking for r/fortnitebr
No it like I’ll hit this guy 2 times in the head mid range with the spectre and he’ll still be alive and kill me
The grunt is not elite but it’s a very good weapon if you like semi auto or slower fire rates. It has high damage for an A/R and can have the perk of adding damage (up to 55%) if you stand in place. Really good also with first shot Rio where the first 6 shots crit, then you can perk it to 2xCD, damage or reload speed and headshot damage. The majority of weapons that everyone uses are best because they are good regardless of loadout but there are a ton of weapons that are less known and used that just need the right loadout or peeks and they become really effective. The opinions on Reddit are pretty generic and not necessarily wrong but there are loads of weapons that get dismissed that are really good and fun to play with. Play the way u like of course but it’s great to try different weapons and loadout combinations and decide for yourself!
I like Reyna hookah in this particular situation, because in higher elo jetts usually play long (smoke garden, clear it, smoke middle of tube, dash into it and gain info) so that leaves Reyna to clear hookah with cypher (Reyna goes in with a blind, if someone shoots it cypher and Reyna swing together) though I would have liked for brim to play hookah with Reyna because stim and clear, Reyna can util and run away, easier for brim to smoke site and hold flank from hookah since he is pretty much a gun machine after his util dump (smoke default, molly ct or save it for post plant)
This should be a guess the rank post
Well none binary is a social concept, it has no other meaning than that, if I ask you to call me the best looking guy in the world and a god of all god then would you? I don't think you would.
Omen. Hardly ever contested. Have his own flash (kinda meh but better then nothing) easy rotations/spike grab with ult. Great personality. Highly recommend
Theres SO MANY hidden ones on lotus
I saw that, and couldn’t find it as well
Ah, thank you.
Why are dudes so cringe online 😭
I appreciate this comment. I got to silver2 and got bumped down to bronze1 and now in my lobbies i'm 1-3rd frag overall and it kinda feels like smurfing. I don't understand the system, tbh. It was just a bummer after working so hard on my aim. I know im not gold like OP but still a bummer when i was a practically a body shot demon
How’d you get the deluxe version?
Could you send me your tracker link? Since that seems to be most of your experience last act I would like to check the matches there myself
Also, your first mythic weapon is a quest, so you can get another mythic weapon the next day after  daily reset… then after that you can only do one a week after the weekly shop reset so you could get 3 mythic weapons in the next 4 days ish if you’re able to get a team together and win
Chaos was clean for me til I bought it 💀
Lotus A site - not, and also even if it was it'd be because it's the hardest to hold

Sunset B - Yeah,  because if you plant you win if u just play for spam

Pearl B - Yes, because it's broken and B is better

Icebox B - use any dog/drone/recon

Bind B -sure

Haven A - not, and also even if it was it'd be because it's the hardest to hold
[removed]
No, because I'd actually have to learn an agent.
it’s a 1v1, stand still all you want
Hm, I see. Thanks for the explanation :)
Thank you, sorry I'm fairly new to this app an don't really get it too much yet
You may not think so, but you literally posted a full minute long video of you doing exactly what I said you were doing wrong
Reyna is busted in ranked and absolutely worthless in pro play. Like I said, pros should adapt to the game, not the other way round.
You must be on my opponent's team
nobody will get used to it the entire community wants it removed
I’m guessing this: your MMR is dogshit. You are placed with people iron and bronze 1 when you are about silver. This means you can’t do good unless they are below your rank. Since they are much lower and you lost you lose a ton of RR. But when u win against irons you gain nothing. It’s because the game notices you can’t play against people your lvl so they place you with lower ranks.
But not all must die for a round win
did you post  this video on youtube witch resolution 1080p??Can I use your design and create one video??Did you have some more details about hew history? I'll give all credit of course hahah
This game is reading my mind, I'm still thinking which skin to get, protcol or blastx phantom.
Spectrum, ruination, Magepunk guardian.

For a whole week, they all showed up
This subreddit was made before battle royale, and is therefore centered around the paid "expansion" Save the World. You're looking for r/fortnitebr for your complaints about the new car mods and health increase.
I haven’t played her yet and I haven’t played many MATCHES with her yet, but the smoke after death has come in clutch a few times, and so is her self revive.

I say I like her

- Reproduction Rate:   100%

Sure, you know that and I know that. I suppose this post is more directed at those who are saying the time/effort to unlock a new agent will be the same as it was with the old system.
Age rate is very low, still I'm always fascinated by adults here, I'm 16 and I love playing with people around your age, it feels rewarding knowing games make relationships likes this. Please never stop doing what you love
>This is your own personal tidbit

Ruining a game for other 7 or 8 players isn't a "personal" tidbits.

You were the one who got off on telling others what to do with their games firstly dude.

>Honestly, you being complete garbage at a game kids can get Radiant in is not my concern, nor my problem.

Nor is your ten or twenty year old friendship our concern or our problem. If you're so concerned about playing with your friends, play unranked and stop ruining other's game and then start crying when you, rightfully, get called out on it.

>Get better or stop crying.

Awww, says someone who probably gets smothered at their elo so they use 'friends' as an excuse to feel better about themselves lmao.
I only call lamps if they are in the building with lamps and u hall of in the non building part of u haul lol
I hope there won't be a bad agent like Harbor
main issue i had with icebox was A site being too ratty and B site being too awkward adter they chsnged yellow from diaganol to parallel. also viper was way to dominant. this said i would take icebox even if it still had all the bugs such as jett managing to get up to crazy angles over the shit map pool we have now with bind (dont kill me i js think its been here too long), ascent (no real diffrent strats esp in pro play) lotus, sunset and split being the worst imo
Turning walls into nonbreakable deadlock walls is kinda what I'm thinking. Maybe even no wall so you can move through it. Would be absolutely wild and cool to see, no idea how to balance that mess though lol
right now silver 1 :pain:
Sad sack
Yeah I thought so too. I’ll try again tonight and see

Not just nerfed, gutted
Neither one
I’m subbed to both Val and CS subreddits, can confirm we are all miserable as tac-shooter players. Always have been. 
Valorant death match is the worst, full of try hards with max volume waiting for people to run a corner
They should, but that leads to a lower number of accounts, which also means fewer skins purchased. Pretty sure Riot cares more about profit than competitive integrity

Im high silver our reyna was bronze 1 with insane aim and mechanics but she was never entering and just baiting everyone every time. don't know if they were smurfing. i told her to play initiator instead.
I was expecting a rank reset, but I placed p1 when I was p2 last act? My hidden elo is definitely high Diamond though
i wish there was more though, the lore is the only reason i play the game lol
It's been tough recently. I also think vibes in general are low. Rarely are people joking and just having fun. Maybe that's just because comp is serious and people need to focus.
What drum shotgun ? The Room Sweeper ? Why would you be mad at people using it on zombies
I play ranked casually, as I find that I do better by playing casually compared to trying my very best.
blind 1 tap hs's are a little too strong in val, i have seen it happening so much lately
Opponent Reyna
L Bozo😭😭
This whole post is looking for gotchas, I don't know what you were expecting. If you want to climb, then it's your job to make sure you're doing everything that you can to be blameless. This includes going out of your way to check in on teammates to see what they're doing. This is especially true in lower elos, where people just don't talk much.
Add as friends, I've tried doing it by epic username, but they don't show up on the list.
Not my fault you cant play on it lmao. But it is one of his best maps
there he goes, this is hilarious
in low elo people typically wont comm effectively
middle elo the comms get better and more helpful 
in high elo players will comm less due to the average game sense and knowledge of each player

but clueless players are in every rank and so it is recommended to comm heavily (almost backseating)
[removed]
Probably cheating ngl
I've been running the Bisexual card since it came out. It's gotten me flirted with a few times and a few comments from some cringy kids. Honestly you know those cards you get at the end of the battle pass that's a gold variant? Those I've gotten the most comments on. Like, "You already have that, get a life bro."
Yeah but how did you get out?
So do my teammates in ranked
No but children are the only people who will claim they won’t share their birthday, piece of information that gives next to 0 information about your identity, for “privacy” reasons…
i feel like if it was specialised like that, people might wanna purposely play that agent just so they can hear the line and if its like jett missing her knives like someone else said, people might throw just to hear it. but aside from that i think it would be pretty neat
Kill enemy before they kill you.
Has anyone been emailed xbox codes? Its nearly an hour after launch and havent seen a single xbox code
It’s a good nerf. Old Jett mains in high elo literally had their brains turned off pre-nerfs because you could just insta dash/smoke/updraft to escape and just wide swing everything too.

She’s heading in a great direction and she still has her identities except Jett players actually need to use their brains now.
No, I just have enemy outlines on yellow.
Hardstuck gold but I duo with my friend most of the time
Can't be OP if it's a core mechanic that everyone uses. I think Riot did a great job with it.
*Shinji, crank that soulja boy.*
In my opinion, the stats we have available aren’t the best way to determine usefulness to a team (e.g omen, deadlock and breach stats I mentioned), but we can agree to disagree
I hit a raze rocket for 150 and some guy didn’t die to it. I am gonna find my way into riot and turn raze’s rocket into a delete button for the enemy team.
If you want to coach Valorant, you need to check out Woohoojin on YouTube. No one comes close to doing it as good as him in my opinion.
I browse this subreddit wayyyy too much. A large percentage of new posts are players complaining that they can’t rank up. Why? For reasons entirely outside of their control of course. Blaming teammates, blaming servers, blaming RNG, blaming anything besides the only common factor, themselves. Those of us who have every actually committed to a grind to get better at a game know what that entails, and these players are absolutely not committed to getting better. They just want easy scapegoats..

That is a skill issue, and it should be called out as such.
Or have option in settings like in dota 2.
Called 'strict solo matchmaking'.
If you click it, you can only be matched with solo players.
(It will match you with solo players and not only with ones that have this option enabled)

I want a viet agent or greek agent
I'd prefer if you, the person using the ult, heard the same thing as the enemy because it's a lot more menacing and you know when you use the ult so you know it's allied lol. your team could hear the ally sound to not get it confused, it doesn't matter that they hear something different than you say, if enemies already do that
Wrong sub. You are looking for r/FortniteBR
Wrong subreddit. This one is for Fortnite save the world. Also you value rare skins over actual good looking skins bla bla bla and the usual text
Ninety percent of ny games have a full team of comms so maybe you just having a bad run 
Hmmmm I'll take your word for it, but first I need to test it.
[deleted]
It's temporary. Valorant will nerf her to balance later on. Right now she's a new agent and should sell like hotcakes
Riot did say that the game will have different balancing as it goes on. Obviously most changes will be universal but there's gonna be some things that are just unfair on console
Yeah doing them right now can be tricky to find them at least in the venture maps
Chamber was nerfed much harder than Jett was IMO. His nerf changed his role and gameplay from a pseudo duelist to a proper sentinel. The duelists in the game, even after their nerfs, are still designed to be duelists. I can still smoke and dash in as Jett; I just have to be more thoughtful about it.
no? i experimented with sens for months before settling on 186, its perfect for me. I had no idea demon1 uses it, im just using whats good for me
lol tysm
It's a way to prevent players from intentionally queueing with cheaters while not being in their party, I think
Nice!!
Maybe. Maybe not. It was removed because it didn’t have to do with battle royal specifically. 

Other people liked it before it was removed. Hence why I reposted. Just having a good time over here :)

save strafing for long fights in low elo. most players  dont have the aim for long fights even when stationary and i’ve literally watched people just give up trying to fight me when strafing cuz they have zero tracking capabilities. 

in close fights theyre gonna spray and pray because they get enough lucky shots that it works. so your best play is to just out aim them.
Maybe for cyphers cage? But apart from that, having that system for abilities that can do damage would make line-ups trivial in a way. Not that it completely removes the skill necessary, but I reckon it's both more exciting and satisfying when you clutch with line-ups without being informed and just using general map knowledge.
Default is stereo, this toggle is for people that only have 1 ear or have some kind of hearing problem.

You can unslot it and upgrade it just don't modify the perks
That's literally his gimmick, he's supposed to be a good 1v1 agent. Remove his E and his back to being dogshit because the only thing that ability did before was give him a faster reload time until he secures a kill... 

  
Every agent has their own gimmick.
Plat probably, just from the way you were holding the u haul angle and clearing it.
I would think the ones that slow you are cold
what his age gotta do with anything though

Or bring back founders for people who are already founders (if they want to be all exclusive or whatever still)
Oh bud. Context matters here. 

The huntsman v3 is an extremely new keyboard only coming out mere months ago. Of course it's adoption rate isn't going to be the same as the wooting that came out nearly a year and half ago now. I'm sure the adoption rate will be much higher as time goes on. 

And even still someone like Sadhaak uses it.  One of the most consistent IGL's in all of VCT. It doesn't matter if more people use the wooting, which has been out for much longer. Of course they are as that's the new tech just as in any sport when new breakthrough equipment comes out. But you ask where's Razer in all of this? Literally one of the best IGL's is using a Razer optical and that's just one name I searched up in 2 minutes of research. If he's playing better and performing better than his competition to consistently reach Masters and place high in the tournaments then everyone else's original point against yours still stands. He's outperforming most Wooting players with a Razer. 

It's up to the user to master the tech and up to the user whether they like it or not. The wooting doesn't move left and right at the perfect time for you. It's still up to you to master that and use it situationally to your advantage. That's the entire point everyone's tryna tell you but your convinced this keyboard is some script for automatic counter strafe that wins you every duel vs someone not using the wooting.
Kill your friends
You hope you get it in the store and pay for the overpriced skin. Wouldn't reccomend getting started on the skins tho lol
Long time ago I made some friends, but i don’t see them online anymore.. I play BR with my kids, but they do not understand StW yet, so I mostly do solo and fill lobby’s in StW. Not always the best lobbies, but not complaining. Now playing ventures since its mutant storm season with a lot less vbuck missions..
The problem with chamber is that his mains are crazy baiters that would watch 4 team mates die in front of him without attempting to trade just because he hold another line that he likes more.

Usually agents are all capable of crazy good teamplay but "some kind of people" have clear preferences on their agents because of the kind of gameplay they use. 

Chamber is one of these agents that cather exceptionally well to the baiting type of players. Given that those guys play a lot chamber it greatly reduces his perceived viability and strength.
its such a simple answer. get better, stop blaming ur teammates.

be humble, dont think ur superior to everyone.

its not impossible to lose a 40 kill game, its also possible u dont understand how some kills are infinitely more impactful than others. ive seen my fair share of duelists who think getting kills is all that matters. ive seen my fair share of ppl who think stats are the only thing that matters.

if brim wins a 1v5 due to lineups, thats essentially an ace, but its not on the scoreboard. so many things are not reflected on the scoreboard. stop digging ur head into stats and numbers.
Let's be honest he's still gonna continue making mad money streaming. He was making $16k a month off of discord subscriptions ALONE. Imagine the primes and donations. That was 9 months ago. Dude's probably making at LEAST 30k a month nowadays.
just put the range in training mode so the bots are just there and you can just keep shooting them while practicing strafing between shots. 

Swinging generally means running out further than needed. lets use A main for example on ascent. Swinging out means you are exposed to multiple angles when you should take your time and peek just enough to first spot dice, then further out to peek heaven, then you peek out further to then see genny. It takes a couple seconds longer but then if an enemy is holding you from site then you have a higher chance of taking that fight more evenly instead of swinging all 3 angles at once and you dont know where to put your crosshair. its basically a process of elimination
One Adam to another, that’s some fine ass gameplay right there
It was added since the introduction of wildlife. Any consumables in general. 

There was a time where you could toss subwafers to your teammates. But was fixed later.
lol unironically a teleporter system (instead of the airport conveyor belts) like what bind has could work super well for breeze
You can hear it coming from a mile away
That might be me with 66.7% winrate on Breeze.
I still hate this dogshit of a map.
It's to make players put more thought on how and when to use abilities. It's called a tactical shooter for a reason. Also, it's to add more gun play. It's a shooter game, after all.
There is MMR and SBMM in every game mode. The parameters for who it matches you with are just much more loose in unranked game modes for obvious reasons.

i done chickens in 2 games hotel mision.. but i done before update.
Ok, but 90% of games are people that don't all speak the same language, so it's just back to "someone is being toxic to me and my other teammates who don't understand won't rally, so let's grief"
Some people waste what potential they have to be immature and petty I guess.

About me at my 1000hrs my peak was p1 bt at 1500 i am now ascendant 1..idk how it happened bt now the game feels ez
I've had like 4 or 5 encounters this season, granted, only one of those was in ranked and weirdly enough 3 of those played Teemo.
Bro’s name is feetluvr69
I end up flying off the map more than I care to admit. Like it's okay guys.... I just punched something.
real and then my instalock reyna is 4-8
They're gonna be under the 'expansion schematics' category and then the 'vacuum tube weapons' tab 

  
\-- I was just about to say that it costs V-bucks to unslot but nope, they changed it to legendary flux! 10/10 change imo 20vbucks to unslot was goofy lol
Because overwatch has no strategy past composition and their pro scene died.
yea u have a point but I can't go off meta in those 2 maps haha, in pro play it's omen then astra
Maybe like Romanian or something in Eastern Europe. Or like mucho macho stereo type wrestler person.
Bro didn't know about this til now... yikes
Truly a bargain for 400xray each.
600+ euros
Nah
"please crush my balls with a hammer" - random swiftplay teammate
3 out of 4 games yea
If the instalock Reyna/Jett and go 6-19 i will trashtalk them until they leave
I think it depends on how much you’ve built up your arsenal of hero’s, weapons and traps. I’ve found that I’m soloing a defense mission then a solid constructor build is mandatory. A good ninja or solider load out helps a lot for offensive missions. And of course you’re gonna need a good farming load out because you will be burning through your materials like crazy. 


Folks on this sub like to sing praises about playing solo to avoid griefers, traders and leaches but I find soloing to be lifeless, boring and expensive. Tempering expectations and being willing to cut your losses in some situations seems to be a better plan of action in my opinion.
Everyday we stray further from God's light
Avarage fortnight update
Sorry, that’s U.K. Time so 1PM pacific
Hi! Ex-neon main here, current phoenix main. 
As a duelist we’re supposed to entry and make space for our team, not lurk. Duelists generally are regarded as a sacrifice to clear site and help make space not to just get picks. Try more to get on site instead. The guy’s kinda right but assuming it’s iron lobbies probably not.
you can try your IRL name translated to some random languages, for example i translated mine to mandarin and looked good to me (ahren), other example a friend of mine got Vinder from finnish or sum nordic language
stil 16:9 no warping so its good.
So it's a normal thing to do; I was thinking that they wanted to trade with me. Thank you for answering.
No, but you also shouldn't recycle a hero you don't have another copy of.
It’s fixed now after latest big update. Phew.
Smurfing if smurfing. Just cause she’s been imm3 in the past doesn’t mean it’s acceptable for Tenz a VCT winner to stomp lobbies on duelist to essentially boost her back to immortal. If the system is working correctly, that means she is at her deserved rank. I’m not a hater just saying what’s right and what’s wrong.
I have 2021 championship and every game I must give it to at least one player constantly. It would be goat skin if it had sounds. But the rarity and music really make it amazing.
It is what it is, which is you lying about being radiant.
yeah her kit is too unique, so much so that it makes her pretty weak or subpar without your team playing off your util, and i won't sugarcoat it but she's pretty awful on attack

i just hope some buffs come in, riot did us sentinel players dirty
probably picked them up from someone else.
It's a Turkish onomatopoeia. Basically a sound effect. 

It's similar to something like KAPOW, BANG or KACHING, but used when something is done with sharp accuracy, in this case, landing a nice shot.

Imagine if "bullseye" had an accompanying sound effect to it. ZINK is something like that. It does not necessarily mean ding/dink, or good or nice.
ye dw I’ve been gold for about 200 games dawg this rank is impossible 
Okay, but why Mortal Kombat? MK is like the most casual fighting game right now
They have experts on marketing analytics at riot. All the prices are quiet perfect for them. 
And lowering the prices on the night market on tripple A skins would be less beneficial overall…
You too!!
Tangentially related, but sentinels or controllers should be the play callers not duelists. So much of the game is map and vision control - thats all controllers and sentinels, duelists are just the pointy stick on the team.
>S1mple got graffiti for a falling noscope awp followed by a med range no scope to clutch a round, ffs.

It was so rare, they made a graffiti of it. You sure that's supporting your point and not disproving it?
Breeze is NOT a breeze cuh
Nice provide proof it doesn’t then, because it does. But have a nice day, google is your friend try it and read the ada could help you.
Ur edpi is 160. Try to keep it in 250-300.
Brother, I know reading the room is not your forte point but like, take a clue. Someone called you a TF2 player and you wrote a testament on why the game is shit. Like, calm tf down. Your insecurities are pouring out.
deadlock, brimstone
Nah, your wrong. Chapter 2 had bi weekly updates as well. Almost every second week there was a new item, while some were just unvaults. Last season had 4 TMNT items, 1 new health item, 1 new AR and technically 1 new MGS item. That’s like around 7 items released in around 14 weeks, but you purposely didn’t include how they added an entire new map, weapon mods, cars, grapple blade, riot shield and new base weapons. That’s like almost 20 new things. And you think it’s not enough lmao. Y’all gamers dopamine is just fucked, you just want want want meanwhile save the world actually has nothing. Honestly if they are putting work into fun mid season mini pass events then idc about not having constant stuff because those events usually have tons of new stuff.

> ? bro what are you saying. It's a video game lol why would they design a character where my team would be upset at me picking them.


Reyna can fit in a comp where people trust you and it fills the aggressor role.  Unfortunatly 99% of Reyna instalocks are picking her because she can heal herself and dismiss out of being traded.


Every agent is playable in this game you're just playing a team game and picking the most selfish one.   There are other agents than Jett and Raze with are fine.


You're quite literally specifically picking the selfish ass character and then questioning why people might not like having it on their team.  
Immortal is the top 0.5% of all players, wouldn't that be considered very high elo?
the smoke nerfs are honestly the worst part of the nerf, she dies as soon as she dashes onto site into her smokes, updraft nerf sucks but its whatever, ult nerf sucks but again whatever, dash nerf imo is quite deserved but i personally think smoke nerfs just kill her ability to last more than a few seconds on site
cant plant spike if im dead in backsite when I try to clear it
Should've did 1 last game beforehand
Bro's a guitar
oh right credits do not exist in escalation and tdm
Copium
right back at you

Because her role is very straight forward and she gets on site with high reliability 




Raze is a secondary duelist and the maps she’s good on, she dominates. Raze can create space, but it’s not the same as Jett. Jett’s cloudburst is just really strong for her to get on site safely 






I’d argue Raze is better than Jett overall, but Jett’s core kit is just really applicable to pro play strategies. Plus she can OP better than anyone not named Chamber, and maybe even then she can OP better than him
you have a reading comprehension problem. I'm telling you exactly what's happening. People who were gold 1 before the rank reset, became unranked, and participated in my, silver 1,2,3, bronze 1,2,3 games. I faced more ex-gold players than silvers and bronze players combined. When people go from gold 1 to unranked, they go into silver and bronze games for their placement matches. Do you understand? and noe i'm not doxing myself.
Why ?

The max level for a hero is 50, you need to evolve them every 10 levels then continue levelling and so on
IKR! I thought I was hallucinating at first. Knew I should trust my instincts!
Yep listen to all of this. I definitely agree too that for Abyss ranked it’s gonna be Astra just because she can smoke the entire map
Well they had skye and sage, so she was possibly getting healed the same time you shot her

I'm not toxic either and i think your system is a decent idea if done properly, but it needs to be done *properly* first.
1440p on a 32” monitor is the same PPI as 1080p on a 24”, so it looks that clear 

Just get a 27” 1440p 240hz monitor or a 360hz monitor if you fancy that. Just know you’ll need a beefy computer for both scenarios
Why are 2 duelists more optimal on split?
lmao
I genuinely hate the maps in ranked rn, split is the only one i really find enjoyable
I’ve also been having the same issue I’m losing like 26 gaining max 14 for mvp even tho I’ve peaked immo 3 I’m now asc 3
Like 12, the whole stack was on
PLS PLS bro i need a code made a whole reddit account

Yah i feel you, but the majority of ppl in high elo do sweat cuz of the effort they put in to get there. Its only the smurfs and trolls on alts who rlly dont care and grief
Bro can't even make sense if he tries
been playing 4 years, since beta and never played with/vs a cheater, its quite rare and i think you are quite delusional if u think ure playing every game w or vs a cheater
bet
I can’t really remember, I think between 150 - 250 ish. I’m gold 3
i dont have problem with strafing targets but have problem with ceouching targets since Im on 300 dpi 0.265 ingame
Why is Kayo not part of the no pants gang?
Do they work fine if connected to smth else?
Most days it's 2-3 some days it's as high as a 7.
Bro I got a 4k on fracture in tower and it started by me fucking up a phoenix flash and it blinding this guy who was right behind me and I was explaining to my friends whilst crying with laughter, then I was like "right anyways" and this poor guy on my team bless him was like "nono finish your joke it's okay :)"

I was like oh you heard that.
ppl are like meta slave and want to win more when they aren't even fully understand the game
No
Oh I see. That's pretty cool actually
guys I need for ps5 pleasseeee
It makes the smile fade from my face when i boot up a non-competitive funny game mode where you kill husks and i see 3 black superhero skins in my lobby instead of anything else the entire game offers you, including your own characters in stw.
Yeah, but among all the glitches that I kept getting over and over, it becomes tiresome
I’d say low-elo duelists I’m D1 currently and I consider that as low elo and I get a lot of duelists that wouldn’t entry first and I play flash initiators like Skye and Kayo and I would go in first instead when i see hesitation
I think you keep reaching. The league demo also skews towards people that buys cosmetics. Also, even if you wanted to argue league has less purchases, ratio-wise, the giant gap in the playerbase means there’s still likely more purchases. Think like 2% of the chinese market is bigger than 15% of the martket of most countries. League’s popularity means it likely has more sells.
r/VALORANT will be [participating in a site-wide protest](https://old.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/142qffd/rvalorant_will_disable_all_posting_and_comments/) on June 12th against reddit's proposed new changes that would result in the removal of all third-party reddit clients. Head over to the link to find out what's happening and how you can help!
Yeah u right my bad. I guess when I see something called decent followed by a critique on what to improve and not on what's good, it feels strange. But maybe I should get used it. Either way, thanks for taking the time to view my art 🫶
I'm only plat 2 so take it with a grain of salt but the idea behind split is that the side that fights and gains control of mid has much more flexibility in getting around the map because walking through spawn is so much longer, especially for attackers. Even if you don't push out thru mid right away and let someone on your team lurk, that's better than just 5 mans hoping to trade out evenly every round. In an evenly matched team, pressuring mid every round will always leave both sites with only 2 players max since 1 player will always be "late" because they have to worry about the mid lurk. And if you kill that mid player(s) you now have free reign to hit the weaker site MUCH faster than they can run thru their spawn.
I believe that the most you can use is 6 letters/numbers, maybe 5, and there are some restrictions like no /,?,! or any other special characters.
Possibly.

Example:

Kill 1: classic
Kill 2: Jett knives
Kill 3: gun you picked up off kill 2, e.g spectre
kill 4: repeat from kill 3, vandal as example.
kill 5: pick up operator from kill 4
wait, really?
Whenever I try to explain the feel of the game to someone I always say this imagine if Battle Royale was trying to be Borderlands instead of a PVP and tossed in a little bit of Tower Defense

But I could also say...

You can expect the constant looking for chest and gold weapons mysteriously laying on the floor in someone's attic to be replaced by constantly farming from materials pickaxing rocks, trees and cars

You can expect to feel cheated the first time your weapon breaks although in reality it's no big deal that's what schematics are for you can always make more

You can expect to be harassed by squeaky voiced kiddos in the chat who want to trap you in a box until you trade with them this goes away once you actually get far enough in the game cuz the kids don't actually play

 expect to feel ignored what I mean by this is this is a live service game but don't expect the service to feel very live even though they change things in Battle Royale constantly the rate at which they change things and save the world is abysmal what I mean by that is although we have a Content rotation in save the world there's not so much as far as actual new content drops although this shouldn't affect you too much as it will all be new to you for at least a year

With all this said the games really a lot of fun ... even if you're not a fan of Tower Defense there's something to be said about being inside of a three-dimensional World setting up traps and watching them go to work flinging zombies off a cliff or into a box of traps or straight up into the air is way more of a Zen like experience than watching a monkey throw a dart as a balloon for instance

You can expect to never have to spam build (well almost nearly never)
So many of the DTB missions in canny locations bug out and can’t be completed (no viable track path)
I had a terrible game on pearl not too long ago where the other just went to b every time (they went a once and they lost) and I was solo queuing and we had an omen that consistently messed up their smokes so there was gaps that the enemy team could just see through
just do me a favor and stay off ranked if you even have to ask…
Don’t even try to mention the scum of the earth that is OW2s monetization, it isn’t relevant here, since it’s a completely different game and they have to give out free skins or else their community vanishes (OW1 was so generous that if OW2 gave away nothing, they just lose a large chunk of their fanbase).

Valorant never advertised itself with attainable or free skins, I don’t see why you’re malding about a companies decision to monetize their game in a different way than others. It sucks, yes, but riot isn’t going to change it anytime soon.
I’ve played cypher only a handful of times but I think you’re also forgetting the flank trip can be taken out and he can just watch flank? Or am I wrong? While the others are set up around his trips in (ideally) a safe location waiting for the enemy to try and retake.

If you want to maintain your role range (duelists and initiator), I would recommend you to get Gekko.
I  use Nvidia shadowplay for everything bc im lazy xD But ive used Obs -Great software, easy to use and id reccomend it as the default for anyone  
and i did try one of those online ones that highlights ur 'moments' but I didnt like it and couldnt configure it the way i wanted - however my friends love them (im sorry i cant remember the fkn name... Outplayed.gg? or smth)
They didn't comm at all
For overaim you gotta move and aim at the same time, and start both a ton faster
So then how do you get it?
Ok that was extreme and on tdm, in dm its plat/ascendant and up. But what difference does it make? I'm currently no where near that level and can't practice anything. Wouldn't being last every game be enough to drop the lobby level?
nowhere does this article mention that smurfing isnt allowed mate. ppl who are banned on smurfs are often banned not because they are smurfing, but becase they are toxic, ruining games on purpose or account sharing (like a bought account) or other things that arent allowed. 

afaik, and feel free to prove me wrong with a statement from the TOS, it isnt explicitly against TOS to have multiple accounts.

im someone who likes splitting smurfing into alt account and smurfing. ppl have multiple accounts for different reasons. some dont have malicious intent, some do. some are in between, or feel like they are forced into a necessary evil (like being able to play with friends)



this article u linked is just an article talking about smurfs and smurf detection, and how they deal with it. and i mean, if u read it and used ur brain a little, its not hard to see that instead of banning accounts, these detected smurfs have their mmr inflated big time and im pretty sure ends up in a queue with more other smurfs.

Completely agree
I don't understand how you came to that conclusion. The only thing you're Sayo is that the number of valorant players using tracker has declined
But you died tho
Full VOD would help. Off the top of my head I can think of two things:

1.) you strafe like crazy and are hard to hit, especially on pistols, but you also have lots of movement error, which is why on full buy you get the short end of the stick

2.) you might be doing too long strafes, which would throw off some people in pistol, but is easier to punish with a vandal 

Else maybe it’s the util? Gun rounds usually have much less util and maybe you keep getting punished by enemy util such as blinds, recons etc?
Ascent.  I used to hate Bind but having Breeze in rotation, I now love all maps.
Ice box and breeze are both hated by a lot of people. Both of these maps are open and they have long sight lines. They also have a lot of verticality. Controllers aren’t amazing on these maps either. This is due to the maps being open and vertical. You can see over the smokes or you can jump over them. That’s why viper is the only good option. Her wall is able to cut them off completely. For duelist Jett is by far the best pick. She can awp from a different off angle almost every round. These maps are very repetitive. Personally I think breeze is way worse than icebox. Both of them suffer from the same problems.
Thanks a lot its super usefull

bro seriously man, a smurf or thrower in every match, now i stopped playing compi and just play unrated for fun, they should really do something about smurfs
Oh yeah I saw one of those. Was kinda a jumpscare and now I can't trust any of those blue chests. Got very confused when a blue chest right next to a regular one was safe.
Same 😍😍😍🎀🎀🎀
No it wasn’t. “Still having fun no matter how much we died.” The OP was mad at the trash talk, not the smurfing, so in that case I see no reason they don’t mute enemy chat. It actually makes zero sense, it’s like the OP wants to be angry or some shit.
I nearly made the same mistake but luckily looked at it a bit more closely before hitting buy. 😭 Some of y’all weren’t as lucky though, they really should’ve separated it more clearly.
When I was doing stone wood pl 1-3 I would just run thunder thora and browse my phone/ read a book.
If you want someone like sova (with recon and damaging abilities) I would go for skye or fade. 

If you want to play someone whose a little more agressive I would play breach. 

The one thing you should do is stick to the same type of initiator if you want to get better fast. If you don’t care about getting better fast just have fun learning each agent
I play in NA (Oregon) and racism is pretty common in the morning lobby. Maybe because of the hs kids that play after classes.

Like i keep getting trolled for my accent (yes, I’m south asian), sometimes racial slurs and the call center jokes. 

I just stopped voice communication permanently, unless I play with my duo. And primarily using texts for call-outs and move on. Not worth arguing on internet against some racist losers.

Truly a satisfying clip! 👌
It is, but I’d see epic getting a lot of backlash
Wouldn’t waste your time on any of those !

Play ventures get a weapon voucher & then invest in a too tier weapon
Astra-Harbour(contriller)
Most fun, probably intiator or sentinel (especially KAY/O, Fade . Chamber, Cypher)
YES. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING INSANE
I'd rather have seen the Stamina meter itself reverted back to how it was in the opening week of C5:1, which is basically this perk, but a support plug-in suffices.

I think this will be a perennial support perk for many, but playing ninja to run around leaving damaging space stink everywhere... I dunno. If it has any potential, I don't think it has anything to do with Dragon Slash.

I haven't tried actually playing as stink runner girl herself yet, but if that "affliction" is the same one as the stink bow's, then she's already a dud. Hopefully, that's not the case.
Didn’t they get rid of the other maps in unrated and swift play or am I crazy
My sons account has been doing the same ... My account is fine though.   

Will let you know if I come across a fix.
Can i do it directly from the playstation? The website seems to be down
Yeah, doing on public sucks. I only did on private

+ I've done it because I had more things to do. I don't have much time to stay in front of the computer just playing. While farming with the glitch, I did other things. Amazing for farming BR XP or "Play X missions with X class".

Well, back we go to building. Playing on low levels so a single defender is usually enough
All I've bought is a couple battle passes, but this one isn't for me. Just not enough stuff that suits my style, or features agents I like.

But that's a very personal thing, and I can't tell you what you like or don't like. If you really like the stuff, conisder getting it. If you can't decide, it's probably a sign that it's not for you either. Usually you'll know right away if you really like something, and if that doesn't happen, well, there's your answer.
A flash you can shoot down before it even blinds is not S-tier compared to the average initiator pop flash that you don't even expect.
U still can kill an opponent with shocks, so don't underestimate importance of lineups.
Wait for Champions Bundle its next in line around 1st of August.
Bro, I play with DPI x/y unlocked 1700 on X and 2000 on Y and 0.73 in game and I suck ass. So yeah prolly too high.
Because Riot's business model is just stealing ideas from established games and putting their minimal twist to it. They never cared for fairness. See how they use phone number verification for premier but not for the account itself.
Viper has a passive to restore her toxins.
I don't understand people like that. Sure, it's nice to have an ace and I do usually let people ace with a simple "hey, i found him, get your ace." since it usually boosts people's motivation, but if it's a tough situation, i will not hesitate to shoot.
It shouldn't really matter and some people just like to boost their ego, thinking it's some sort of an unwritten rule to let people ace no matter the circumstance.
I really like the sensor as is but maybe a bit faster and be able to place it vertically too, But I would also like changes is with her wall like being able to place it in buy phase would be a good enough change and a voice line if her wall is destroyed, or something like Deadlock and her team able to pass through the wall freely.
Except Reyna's 95.8% of all Reyna's are toxic. It more likely to find a controller main than a non toxic Reyna
In that situation, you both have to land two headshots to kill eachother, so its a pretty even fight.

Ok cool. Sent psn request bc ur epic says it isn’t accepting friend invites rn
That feeling when you have jump bound to scroll wheel, so you can't float
Yes, in Red toolboxes

I think she's fine on Sunset. I usually pick her if no one picks flank-watching sentinels (this map is a heaven for flankers) and/or Sova or Raze so I can destroy Cypher's B main trap.
Yeah playing with friends only honestly seems like the way to go
It isn't as fast as the wheel nor as intuitive
The abilities aren't supposed to be unique, the overall playstyle of the agent is. We don't need to reinvent the wheel for every character
On those days where you don't have time to commit to actual sessions, spend that time doing a deathmatch or two. Go in the range. Do a 15 minute aim labs session.

This will help you with your muscle memory and keep you in form. 

When you do play, dedicate a set amount of time and try to plan for it so you can be in full focus to get the most out of the time. 

VOD review every week. Take a game or two to look at and see what you could be improving on. This will help you skyrocket ranks.  

Check out woohoojin. He has a lot of stuff on how to do this properly
Loved your explanation. Thank you very much for that.
Likely. Those explosions seem to be based off of the shot that triggers it, and Hero Ability Damage multiplier.
i usually rank up a lot faster solo queue than playing with my g.f or friends so that's not really factual

My peak is immortal 3.  I play 2-3 games every day. Playing comp for a healthy amount everyday is more important than spamming comp for 10 hours and getting burnt out resulting in days being skipped playing.
I'm a protocol and spectrum enjoyer, i love phantom when the bullet sound is "heavy". With others phantoms I tend to spray way too much
Also adding to your point, the Twine “quest line” isn’t that bad, even if it’s very repetitive. I also think this would stop players from getting carried into MSK since SSD 5 requires you to be done with the PL 94 quests. The only unfortunate case is if you want early access to PL 140 zones or if you are an SSD fanatic.

Hard resets maintain MMR? Do you have a source on that?

My intuition would be that they would chop down your MMR down toward the mean. For example:

      New MMR = (Old MMR + neutral MMR) / 2
To put into perspective AR durability, 1.6 durability is a full mag from most full auto ARs. Perhaps the perk could be nerfed slightly to 0.1 or so.
I'm playing battlebit a bit atm, very good.
What sub do I use then? :(
Uit welke provincie kom je?
Yes, I record all my gameplay through medal and go over it afterwards and knit pick my gameplay
I have literally only been getting breeze and sunset in comp too! Three games in a row of both. I wanted to dodge so bad but couldn’t take the penalty lol
Hot take I guess??? You don't need to buy anything. Just don't buy the thing. Just don't buy the thing and they'll stop doing it. Stop buying the thing. Stop buying. Stop. Buying.
What on earth is Neon doing
Oh , yes
I do not have a say but i have 800 dpi with a .6 sens (Yes i can 180 and yes it may be fast but works very well)
Be careful, I think some people’s egos are hurt from not being as good at aiming as they think lol
Why you complaining? At least you have teammates that built and aren't AFK doing nothing.
I think it's been fully taken down today. I still have the app but error code 403, "The API returned an error code 403" keeps appearing.
I'll try to keep these thoughts in mind when reviewing my deaths thank you

lol jett op

She is supposed to be first contact basically take risky fights and get out. Basically peek first then kill the guy then let the main duelist come in with full health if you have no other duelist that can take space fast then use her to slice the pie and clear angles. Only use her to go to other places other than front lines when u know u can take an easy kill on mid then go back to team.
The value of Ventures would be so much better if we had PWO.
This isnt a fortnite sub?

I feel like the devs have never actually touched this game, it’s also insane to me that they thought these changes would be good while nerfing an agent like clove. Did anyone really think they were that OP? They’ve seen 1 pro game since release but that was too much ig
"Where it is today" it wouldn't exist at all

Icebox is my least favorite map in the current pool and it’s not close. I hate the art style, I hate A site, I hate kitchen. It’s just bad imo. I hated breeze like everyone else in the comments but now I kinda like it.

For iron specifically, having bad setups.


Generally, filling and not playing deathmatch
Xenon from a chicken is crazy
Well i make arches and use cone to jump up a level and then just build floors to stay up all the time. And the reason i find Banshee useful is that she has War Cry, which makes you and your teammates destroy horns much easier. Plus, her class perk adds further bonues to war cry via 20 somethis bonus in damage and movement speed...
I don’t even mean hella easy in a cocky way. I truly think like Kay/O pop flashing randomly out the smoke, breach literally whenever and hell even a good YORU flash is harder to turn on than Phoenix.

Of course you can get caught staring right at it if he puts it on the money and you’re in a shit spot… but 7/10 if you see it coming around the corner on an exec you can turn away slightly enough to not eat the full blind and take the fight.

Idk, if you’re a super high rank or something and think this still I’ll admit I’m wrong? But can’t imagine most anyone Dia to Pro-level after three years thinks Phoenix flash is unreactable
Alright !
Killjoy’s “you should run” followed by the ult sounds is amazing
Sent everyone that I could codes
Often it helps to move with the shotgun but your crosshair becomes more inaccurate if you move (not nearly as much as it does for rifles though).

Sometimes with the Judge, making your enemy miss is more important than having more accuracy.

I've found if enemies are further away, you not only need to remain still but you also need to crouch to make the crosshair even more accurate at distance.
Maybe because it's more simpler to say "he"

Like:

"He's on A site" ----> one person A

"They're on A site" ----> multiple people on A?

I feel like for someone who isn't completely fluent in English can mistaken a "they" for multiple people instead of a single person
Report him

I used to like breeze, but after the rework, its breeze. idk why but the map feels even more one sided now
You just gotta practice all game are different, mechanics and abilities are hard to learn but once you get them down you’ll see a drastic improvement
Going from your most recent game backwards for today:

* Your team's bottom frag was 6-14, other teams was 6-13
* Your team's bottom frag was 10-1, other teams was 11-17
* Your team's bottom frag was 12-18, other teams was 10-14
* Your team's bottom frag was 3-20, other teams was 14-17
* Your team's bottom frag was 4-16, other teams was 3-16

You had *one* game today with a particularly bad teammate, otherwise things looked pretty balanced. That doesn't mean all your teammates were good. You're in bronze, it's only bad players so of course you'll get bad teammates. But the other team had the same issue.

You're just mad and coping. If you want real feedback, bring a VOD. You're likely throwing games as much as any of your teammates you're mad at.

Kills are generally good of course, but there's several ways you can farm them while throwing rounds. E.g. you rush when the enemy is on eco and secure a bunch of kills sometimes, but occasionally feed giving up a gun and lose a free round. Or you only bait/lurk on attack as duelist and get ez frags but don't help your team take the site. Or you play for exits and pick up kills a lot but never take a risk to win a round. Etc.
[deleted]
As a beginner you should just be doing shooting range and dm to practice your mechanics and fundamentals.  If DM is too much for you, you can practice peeking and reactions with a sage wall and the regular non aim flick bots.  Practice your abilities in custom maps.  Ranked is likely going to be your most casual game mode for a pure beginner as you'll be with other irons and bronzes.
I have 3 accounts, 2 are my main (so I never lose my rank I keep them the same rank and switch) and then I have my classic only account. I got vct bundle for classic only acc and I buy skins on both my mains. People just like playing with skins bro.

You're doing it wrong if you're unslotting. You should be putting extras in the book, not your only/good rolled 6th perk copy.
This is the best way.  The classic Xbox live clan origins

Your lack of flexibility/consistency is the problem imo.

I've mained duelist in Immortal/Radiant and if you're never going to swap off, other duelist mains are going to end up trying to flex, so you need to consistently pop off.
Adding onto that last thing for OP: Make sure to collect and spend research points EVERY day. Even if that's all you have time to do, it should never be skipped.

Research point collection is based on real world time. Every day you skip is a day longer it'll take in the long run.
Ah, you must have joined siege late if you're still unlocking old agents for cheap. It takes less time to get all the agents in Val than to get 4 of the newest agents in siege (and an eternity to unlock them all). Would be nice if Val had boosters though.

Well, before you accuse me of being a rude know-it-all that throws around geeky lingo as if everyone out there should automatically understand what I'm talking about, I'm simply not that guy.

It was you who introduced the term TRO to the conversation, and thus, I can surmise you are familiar with it. "Loadout" is not geeky lingo, it's the in-game nomenclature stated clearly as a subheading of the "Heroes" tab.

Anyways, I can appreciate that perhaps you're disappointed to learn that your Commander never counts towards a Team Perk, but hey, now you know.

So, my friend, as I am trying to help you here, I'll direct you to some more efficient ways to acquire what you need.

Do missions that offer Road Trip Tickets. A Rad Llama costs 500 tickets, and if you focus on collecting the event tickets from the missions available to you, they should pile up in no time.

Play Hit the Road. The daily offers 100 tickets, and there's higher, longer term payouts to work on as well.

Finally, the easiest way is to recruit a Rad Hero from the Collection Book. An epic/purple hero will do if you're tight on legendary flux and manuals.

I hope this helps get you where you need to be.
No really. I’m proving myself correct.
What skin are you playing
who did you try to buy it from? im not understanding how you can lose your account for buying a battle pass
Thats the annoying part. I really like the sheriff, vandal  and the buddy that comes with it but i don't want to pay for everything
Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time for aim practice because of college, so I just play matches and try to improve my crosshair placement after the boxes and lines across the maps. I noticed a slight improvement and I managed to flick some nice shots. I try to outsmart enemies too cus it feels like a good strategy against players that don't have good games sense and I feel like Yoru is a pretty solid pick for this.

let me just learn a recoil pattern that doesn’t exist btw
Whatever I dont care anymore. You’re annoying.
My friend your evil aura is leaking. 😂😂😂
Stop caring about your rr or throwers or afks and focus solely on improving your own play. It makes every game a useful learning experience and rank will naturally follow.
This is in any rank except immortal+. You lose 90% of rr in immo/radiant. Your hidden mmr stays the same tho.
They're just the goats tbh (a lot of practice)
Have they been released yet? and not everyone has a G to drop on a screen rn.

I say "This isn't VCT" when mfs start asking to surrender when we go down 0-3 at the start, or start acting like their life was ruined and everyone on the team should have been aborted in the womb because of a game we are losing.
I brought my friend in to play Valorant. First FPS game ever so she was self conscious about it. She even cried and uninstalled!! But like even just a month later she got a good hang of it and 3 months later she's an average player. 

My advice? Do unrated. Tell people in the lobby they're actually a new player. If anyone gets toxic, tell her how to mute them and not care about them. Tell her it WILL take time to learn the maps, learn characters and what they do, where to look, where to go. That's probably the most annoying part of being a new player in anything. I told my friend to play Killjoy because her abilities are easy to use and none of it contains much aiming or knowledge. Perhaps some sneaky nano bot placements, but that's not so important when you're just starting out. Anything placed that gets destroyed will be knowledge for the team, so it's a win win for a beginner imo

Swiftplay is crackhead mode and not a good way to learn how to play the game. I was playing swiftplays to get back into the game after like 2 months of not playing, and it did NOT help! XD 

Sometimes she's still a deer in headlights and maybe does dumb stuff when she's the last player standing, but that's normal and understandable, performance anxiety and all that. hahaha
Paint? Check. Explosives? Check. Brakes? Nowhere in sight.

great “advice.” Creepy ngl
got it
Play hours doesn’t mean shit if you’re not learning all the way through. Make sure that you’re learning the basic fundamentals of FPS games while you’re playing and not just thinking of winning and ranking up.
We found another cheater, girls.

Also all previous ascendant 2-3 last episode. Hovering around D2-A1 one.
Not all of us would want to do that, me and my friends usually prefer to have fun and mess around, don't care about team comps much and that would directly affect another player in the queue who actually cares about their rank.
If you die with a sheriff you no longer have the sheriff.
I moved from 400dpi to 800dpi and this shit is too fast to control on the desktop :skull:
start rank doesn't matter  
it's whatever that close to his skill  
this game is easy to rank up anyway if he get better
CS is better in every way besides cheaters. I can’t get over how bad peeking and swinging feels in Val. It’s so slow.

As a low elo player, the problem with playing Odin/Ares is that the opponent team will also start spamming. And it is very difficult to play against spammers. I once lost 5-6 rounds in a row after having a fairly good lead because our team's sage started spamming for no reason.
I hope we can get to 'Jam' in-game too! 
THANK YOU!
The closest i am to 7600 in one game is minecraft, at like 1500 hours iirc. And thats for a family of 5 playing it on and off since we got it 9 years ago. The closest i am to 7600 in a game alone is Destiny 2, in which i have just over 1000, i started playing on release but took a break between season 6 and returned on season 12, coincidentally at the same day that Beyond Light released. Around 50 is from my dad if im not mistaken, he played through the Red War campaign with his friends on release but theyve all stopped played destiny since then.
I max the bp every season and only play like 5-10 matches of br per season

unranked
Aspas is zellsis's nightmare lol
Plss
How's that relevant to Fortnite
lemme guesss .  uh came from cs go?
Then this implies to the player that Riot doesnt care about a player if they're high rank. It's like they're punishing a player who plays well for not wanting to play with throwers and griefers
Damn that's rough
Idk why people freaked out with a challenge item returning, and why they now expect it to happen all the time. It happened once before. The legendary blade of insight returned last December.
I still crouch spray when I need to but I just learned to have tap discipline. I know when to slow down my aim and when to crouch. Crouching is still important for hiding behind boxes or whatever. Some jumps need you to crouch anyways.
Gecko pick rate in pro is actually on the low side of the happy range.

Also people don’t like half blinds. Flashing out of smoke: no one gets half blinded. Phoenix’s flash: no one gets blinded. Ppl don’t like turning from flashes as they flash in (both the flasher and the team). This is why phoenixes don’t reverse flash to flash a wider area either.

TBH ranked is a very braindead space; no one wants to learn cool plays, they want to play the game in the most straightforward way possible and just show their hours on aimlabs while feeing a sense of accomplishment over simple reads and clutches.
A game a few days ago I had an enemy who went around 45-5, why we didn’t ff is it’s own mystery, but still very frustrating
2 years stuck in gold 3. I play the rank up game, lose it, lose 2/3 more games in a row, start winning again, repeat.
Woohoojin.

Use his month to gold video and his movement guide video, watch his weekly low elo stream (check the events tab of his discoes. If he posts a vod of a gold or below player watch it. Avoid the rest (his pro analysis and high rank vods are amazing but they wont be covering things you need as often)

Can also watch vods from dopai and other coaches alongside him if you want.

Have a consistent play schedule. Do the practice every day, record ur practice and compare it to the guides you are following.
crit damage without crit rating is fucking stupid
I have a ressource management problem in ventures, aka 27 unused stacks of traps. So yes please, carry some of it over.
dude is astonished at the team leaving a lurk on his slow rotation and he's going to say his aim wasn't good enough. low game sense players coping hard.

The fact that the siege community (arguably more toxic than Valorant) had less of a problem with a trans operator (Osa) than the Valorant community is currently having with a NB one is WILD to me.
Happy belated!
Yeah I am sticking to 2-4 games a day instead of 6 or smth, because I was playing a lot to get out of my placement ranks
also give us husks that are comprised of all 3 elements simultaniously.... that way the only suitable weapon to use on them is an elemental weapon, making them resistent to specific element weapons.
Nope since I switch from CS:GO I got worse aim and game sense. (Maybe I just got older idk) 🫠
Fortnite isn't really that kind of game. Codes for free stuff are only on rare occasions, and are always limited by either a short time period or a set number of redemptions before it becomes unusable.

Besides, they're only ever for small unimportant things like Banner emblems or Loading Screens.

I also suspect you may be a lost Battle Royale player. There's no general "all things Fortnite" subreddit, this one is solely dedicated to the *original* version of Fortnite, the paid **Save the World*** PvE campaign mode.

The Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortniteBR.
As far as I'm concerned, the role was to distinguish what utils your agents have. Personally? I'm just entering as a controller if my duelist sucks. Or just you said, straight up play it. Jett is far easier than Reyna for me, you don't need kills to dash. Just dash away if it is unfavorable for you.
Backseat and comms are different things and when people learn that, it will be good
If rank does concern you I am plat 3, facing what ranges between plat 1 and diamond 3 sometimes gold 3 or 2 as well. There is no difference between HIGH rank and LOW rank playstyles when it comes to strategy the only thing that differs people in higher rank fight less and aim better. Example a typical teammates I have would have either only headshots \*For couple of rounds\* and after that CROUCH and spray or simply just the entire game \*CROUCH and spray\* While in a higher ranks they mostly adjust their aim constantly and aim decently good the entire game. And another difference is the understanding of one's agent, rather than picking first timers non stop in a higher ranks you will find more often people who main certain agents and actually know all tips and tricks in one's agent.   
  
Example a Yoru from higher rank will be a nightmare to play against while in a lower rank you will see him flashing himself only.   
  
There is no other differences than this. If people rotate in higher ranks just as stupid as lower one's that means they got good aim, but certainly have 0 strategy or braincells to make any calls or decisions on themselves. 

If you wish to rotate, rotate before your duelists enter or rotate when u actually have a reason to, is there a cypher? Sage walled? they slowed u down? Kayo caught u? But if your duelists already on site and they picked some off and you rotated? by all means that's a troll a banned well deserved imo.

And blaming teammates has nothing to do with games I play or not, I am not blaming TEAMMATES, I am blaming \*ROTATERS\* I do NOT rotate therefore I cant blame my self \*FOR ROTATING\* if I didnt rotate lol. Its like blaming my teammates for not buying me a gun with my money which I am supposed to click on my self, doesnt make sense at all does it?

And I rarely talk in game, voice chats are kind a joke because I always almost mute everyone so I dont argue with idiots, but that's not the case. In game voice chat should be used to give info only so if people spammed \*LEFT LEFT LEFT BEHIND BEHIND etc...\* I mute them without saying anything, same with people who say \*Rotate\* etc.... I try to avoid arguing and focus more on the game and mute those who are responsible or may be responsible for losing if not muted and ignored.
I just like it
Oh actually I think the coaching could be fun! I'll try suggesting that.
My nephew, who is physically active and has a pretty successful life, still has issues speaking properly and formatting complete thoughts. He always has little weird ticks or social awkwardness. Whereas someone like me can have a full conversation about nothing to a CEO of a business or to a child. Young adults today just don't have the social skills that those have that did not grow up glued to their phone, unless they made an effort to learn those skills.
Do you buy util on econ/pistol rounds? Maybe its just that you have less util to use during those rounds, which makes you more focused on your gunfights whereas on fullbuys you're more worried about using util and thus you're doing worse when taking gunfights with less focus

No shame in that tho just keep improving you'll get there
Average lobby rank doesn't matter, each game mode has it's own hidden MMR. If you're playing no highlights and doing awful then the next game will have lower hidden MMR comparatively.

in cs 1.6 you used to be able to have custom sprays, you could have a nude, watch people stop and stare and get free kills it was really funny even the dude that got killed would be laughing usually
Lmao why remove it
Thank you!!! ;__;
It’s pretty rare in a game to be holding an angle and someone comes stomping through with no utility. 

IMO it’s much better to play with sound off or very low as the duels will be more realistic.
what is up with your audio jesus christ
No it's been happening in league since the start. They make money off it
Oi, friend. Ye lookin for r/fortniteBR
Boosting my friends ≠ getting drunk on my second account and playing with them 

If you dislike how riot built the game then stop playing it and bitching. There are countless other games to play
Oh you’re right, I haven’t heard all their voicelines yet. That’s kinda dark.
You should honestly delete that part of the comment. You're spreading misinformation in a subreddit that has a massive hate boner and refuses to research claims like the one you made.

The only think I smoke now is weed and that’s just herb. I felt like carts were fucking up my lungs just like my vape, and I do feel better after cutting those out too. 

But I was legit smoking almost a whole gram cart everyday, and like a juul pod a day at least too. But occasionally ripping a cart is honestly not bad. As long as you aren’t hitting a blinker every 30 minutes, you’re still a saint in my eyes lol.
1. Don't look at the floor

2. Don't move while shooting.

3. If you get killed while trying to use utility you made a mistake.

4. Stop looking at the floor.

5. Don't trust your teammates to do anything, play for yourself

6. Don't lurk and flank the entire match. It gets you meaningless kills, good for your K/D, bad for your winrate

7. Seriously, stop looking at the floor. There's nothing there
In my first game, someone was screaming in comms to "check heaven". I was like "but we are already in haven right? It's the name of the map right?"
Eh in low elo reynas a good one trick agent. The only thing that matters in low elo is winning gun fights. Comp doesn't matter. Coms don't matter. Just use bullets. Reyna excels at just using bullets. She turns a coin flip into a 30/70 the same way chamber and jett can. Sustain for sloppy duels. I get why some people will say "snap lock reyna" .  Pheonix also good for this i feel.
Lotus is amazing
...did the corner camping Cypher have more than 5 kills?
some toxic ppl just want to blame ppl for chaos tbh
Yeah if you look at tracker, the game will try to make your map played even, so if you already played 300 ranked and got like 40 games on each map already, the new one will have higher chance of getting picked
Okay so you seem to be forgoting about adhevise, batteries, bacon, gizmo, herbs and blast powder? Bc of expedition, I spend my games shooting zombies and being useful unlike you that probably spend half the match in anti material galore. "Shoot the npc" its called SAVE the world not farm the world...  why dont you play farmville at this point? Lol
Nah, Doom has a techno-hell aesthetic. That’s literally the Prelude to Chaos skinline.
log in to the Epic website via your kid's Xbox login, and unlink the Xbox login, then re-login to your main, you should know what to do next
i used to main cypher in 2022 , trust me bro the judgement you get when you use cypher is phenomenal. Also the opponents dont really know to counter a cypher and his tricks. THE BEST PART IS THE TRICKS OMFG
By "filling the map" u mean flanking from the empty area or something? Because i ain't that fat lel.
With 100 creds per bullet, I always purchase the trap and 6 bullets on pistol rounds. On eco, I always make sure I'll have 4100 credits on the next round (strong shield + rifle + trap).

On the rest of the game, I'll purchase the Headhunter whenever I have spare credits. Its quick draw is fantastic when you're mid gun fight and run out of bullets. Also it's great to have to those bullets already purchased when you reach an eco round, means I can probably purchase a strong shield and still have credits for a full buy next round. Headhunter with 8 bullets plus a strong shield is diabolical on eco rounds.

As for the ult, I used to save it for eco rounds 'cause I wasn't very comfortable with sniper rifles. Now I just use it whenever it feels rights to use it. It's absolutely insane the versatility of gameplay you have when you're able to carry an OP and a Vandal at the same time lmao
its personal preference tbh, i can't snap with the neo frontier deagle but can really well with the kuranami one.

Umm, in the comparison, 80% of the time it's a premium skin vs a blue/green tier skin, which makes the votes skewed? Sure, with a large amount of data it also evens out, due to all the skin combinations being tried out, but yet, I feel like you should be comparing the non-premium skins with other non-premiums only.

However, amazing execution, I hope lots of people use this and give us some good data.
Mann Epics just salty they couldn’t make more money off mobile players. All fortnite is now is just a big cash grab, i doubt they care about any of their players.

Actually a great idea. This has been in CS for years and it’d be so great to see an official version of it in Valorant. Sadly, I don’t think it’s possible.
Ok just I have a lot of 144 traps already
Maybe at the range it goes that high but during gameplay expect 400-500, with dips to 300.
thanks! it worked
But still good momentum chief 👏🏻
^ this. 

i had a game not too long ago where i was fully convinced my brim was hard throwing.  we win first round on split attack easily.  second round, we hear skye dog b site and hear a bucky.  our brim throws catterpillar smokes *after* hearing the bucky and then proceeds to walk into the site.  this to me seems like an obviously terrible play and he predictably dies for it.  i ask him why he does this, and he apologizes and realizes it was a bad play and we move on and proceed to win the game.  he wasn't actually throwing and just made an absolutely horrible play.
Most duelists have some kind of mobility, or some kind of skills that can be instantly activating without a pullout animation, or both. This allows them to push the pace of the round by moving in quickly and/or using their skills to bail themselves out of bad positions. Phoenix is the only duelist that doesn’t really have either of these, but he has his ult only costing 6 orbs so it kinda makes up for it (but also Phoenix kinda sucks so lol). Gekko does not have either of these. He has no mobility and all of his skills are a bit ‘clunky’ to use compared to duelist skills.
Plat and bronze in the same match looks balanced?
I find that it really depends on the time of day you are playing. Right after work, 5-11pm you'll have team-mates who are more willing to comm but anytime outside that... I find that I will be comming alone. 

However do not let that dissuade you. If you are the only one comming, keep doing so because most of your team-mates will still hear you and hopefully listen to your call outs. It tends to be the case in my plat lobbies.

Watch some coaching vids, learn some plays and carry your team with call outs rather than your aim labs prowess.
>Ima be honest it's probably your mentality. I'd recommend you keep training in dm and tdm as well as some training in aimlabs. Keep this up and take a week break from ranked. You will probably do a whole lot better when you come back. I just got done with my break, and I'm doing a lot better than I was.

I will try this out, ty
Well for the game to be terminated and no stats count why not just go afk if you’re playing bad then
imo they are throwing cause mental is 80% of the match
Noble of you and a good way of looking at it
YOU could've started with that!
Counter-stikes replay system sees what the server saw, not the players. So it fully depends if it's recording while you play, or if it's a download from the server post game.
I need someone to send me a code please i beg

She’s not particularly good, she’s annoying to play with, and annoying to play against. 

Really just the worst of all worlds. She makes the game worse by being in it.
Bruh glad I got this for 20 euro back in 2017 lol
The argument of "just don't buy it then!" like so many say doesn't make sense to me because if everyone followed that the game would get no money and would stop running.  They should be enticing people to buy things by making them affordable which they'd end up buying more of.  The problem I have with the pricing is its so much that I get pretty much one skin per gun then that is it unless something just that much better comes out.  Since I wait for what I really want nothing better really comes out and there isn't much I need to buy anymore other than battlepasses and I didn't like anything in the current one at all.  I know they need to make money but I know for me personally if they were half the price I'd buy skins weekly/monthly, like I used to do in league. There isn't even a random option for skins so owning more that one per gun seems pointless as well.
Xbox series S
I LOVE BALD CYPHER
me?
For a warm-up, try just doing bots in the range and a single deathmatch. It's definitely not enough but it's definitely better than nothing. I can't play Kayo even now lol, I'm always afraid of flashing my team (gold 2). Even just not moving while shooting is good for iron, I remember the last time I was there that run and gun was fairly common even at mid ranges lol. And if you feel like your aim is better than the average player in your lobby, pick Reyna. I don't ever play duelist (initiator mostly), but I hear it's the best way to get out of super low elo, especially because it helps you improve your mechanics the most while not having to think about your utility much.
I think when i que with a friend in immortal so only duo que, it is overall easier to play because i know atleast one teammate is guaranteed, while in solo que i can have wildly inconsistent games. it feels very different to go into a game where everyone is communicating in the pre lobby-3 insta lock duelists with no coms. I like atleast having one player who is consistent!
the numbers are red because the squad members don't have the same personality as the leader, Spacebound, if you've got some survivors that match the Ned that isn't that other Ned's personality, swap the squad out for those survivors

YOU FUCKING MELONS!!!
this is not an example of backseatjng, this is actually very helpful and sometimes the clutching player doesn’t realize.
damn sorry wrong subreddit
Just make the game cost like $5. That way it's still accessible but making multiple accounts will start to add up + streamers and whales who make multiple accounts and buy skins for all their accounts will still able to do so, so Riot still gets their money
Finally something good. Does this fix all the build the radar tower missions where one area is barely under the ground and you can't build it?
Damn, I was GM once also maining Widow but for the love of me I couldn't transfer the aim to the games I play now (VAL and Apex). Nice shots honestly!

Time to get my beauty sleep, this whole season
Good point 🤔
The BR fandom has been pessimistic about how the game feel has changed since Chapter 5. People are speculating that skins that doesn’t have a LEGO outfit are not going to return to the store; The musical events are no more, and put into creative maps instead; Non-collab skins were nerfed in the Item Shop and the Locker; The lore is nowhere near as interesting after the OG season or even earlier…

Is like seeing STW on 2019 all over again, EXCEPT for the fact that no one is complaining about the gameplay/graphics in which those has been as good as before.
I love the winter/holiday seasons

Genuine question, what made you supercharge wooden floor spikes? I love them as a slow down trap but they’re not something I would ever consider upgrading
Yeah man just found an annoying loophole lmao
I got 50 kills with Clove a while ago, and the 2nd fragger below me had 23 kills so I think this was my highest kill game and carry. 

I didn’t even manage to win the game and it ended in a draw, but I still gained +11 RR from it. 

I was on a really long losing streak, deranking from plat 3 to plat 1 and due to my MMR going so low I git matched with silvers and golds so I was just destroying everyone in the lobby and also my aim just was extremely good for some reason at that time. Also I had been playing the game for around 2-3 years (including long breaks of a couple of months tho)

Server Crash
I peaked immortal 3 and lower lobbies can be hard because people are just brain dead and you can’t predict brain dead players.
Here's a higher quality video without the flatlining: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuwRIg\_q4zQ&ab\_channel=WinstonZheng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuwRIg_q4zQ&ab_channel=WinstonZheng)
Nah ult on buy, don’t buy gun.
Yeah cause I play at a level where people know how to fake, walk around secretly, not just run in and make loud noise. It’s why coms are important to makeup for the fact you’re playing against 5 people trying to win as well
Favorite: Spectrum internet! Oh wait, wrong thread
i literally check corners irl
Not crouching and counter movement
I fuck with the movement. Ts looks so smooth.
Weird because I didn't change anything. Hopefully, I can find a solution for it.
Wouldn't explain how they got the same agents
that means gold 3 is your skill level. keep playing and you'll slowly get better
It's bought on occasion, most often if you win pistol and depending on the map.
I really wish there was a way to not play with kids! it's so frustrating. I've tried finding people to game with but I have a demanding full time job and I can't play that regularly so it always kind of fades out and I have to find a new group of people to play with.
Ykw that is true, good point

Ig the lack of consistency is mainly for balance

The flaw about ISO's design is that 99% of his value is in his one shield ability so it'd affect him too much ti make it stoppable by knife (meanwhile keeping it up just makes ISO that much stronger when his shield's buffed up like it is rn)
I say leave the shop as it now but have the night market reset once a week after they open it, as well as make the kind of skins you can get from the night market better.
That was a joke
more like you should intentionally be better in comp, because you’re trying harder, if you’re just a god and you’re playing unrated oh well sucks to be the enemies
how would it not? why would anyone play through OT when you can just play for a draw where everyone wins? blud wants to climb with his monitor closed and hands tied behind his back LMAO
And wait 10min for queue, no thanks.
Is miniboss season still a thing? If so when is it pls
lol okey
Oh gosh, no way a Radiant, one of the 200, had never ran into Woohoojin before. Like, what are the chances? 

Use your brain.
Sunset, with my trusted 5 stack.

I play Brimstone.  
Phoenix, Cypher, Sage and an Initiator added to that.

Cypher can hold A alone, Sage plays B. Phoenix holds top mid, Initiator into marked and I start out mid and rotate fast.

\>75% Winrate atm. People just have not fully figured out how to play that map yet, it's enjoyable to capitalize on that.
Misspelled loser again 💀
Kills aren't everything. Even pros at an international level will go *very far* into the negative because their role isn't slaying out

Ha I wish. I'm stuck in the eternal "do x missions"
Having a queer character is no more an agenda than having a cishet character, just because don’t like it doesn’t make it nefarious. Nothing is being shoved down your throat by having a character exist you have some serious fragility issues. And yes I am aware of sweet baby inc, it is a consulting company with minimal input on games, that has been part of some of the most successful games of the year such as Alan Wake.

If having minorities makes it hard for you to relax you should seek therapy.
I agree
I usually dont trust Gekko mains because they have a habit of throwing in their wingman with spike onto site when no one is ready…so pls dont be that person.

Make sure your team is ready to execute and that wingman can be protected on site!
Ohhh I didn’t see this comment but okay I can understand that
So do you also want to buy all these people new hardware so they can?
June 11th with patch 8.11. Breeze and Split are rotating out, Haven and a new map are rotating in.
There are cool skins but nothing is MUST buy.
suygetsu may explain why so
deserved!
Probably Iso tbh. Completely new to the game but i hate his shield. Anyone who uses Iso i believe just closes their eyes and shoots at opponents praying a bullet hits their head because they know the shield has such a strong durability. Idk. Maybe it’s just me. I also think it’s weird to have the shield as a feature then a private 1v1 as an ultimate. Just pure weird.
I felt like astra was just easier i mean you literally place them with your god damn hands
Yeah I use Base Kyle and top upgraded wood does the job everytime.
It's also a good way of spending all of the 5k stacks I have in my storage lol 😂

I can find more if you need me to.  Multiple instances of reports and statements corroborating the idea that women will be looked over and left on the sideline due to culture and gender based decision making.  We have owners literally saying that a “female player would be an uncomfortable distraction.”  Or multiple players saying they wouldn’t play with a woman on their team lol.  I could go on and on about how little interest a esports org would have for a female pro, even if she was the best fit for the team.
No he's bronze from this reset lol
Chamber.
I like to shoot head.
I fucking hate it when the troll takes spike the whole attacking half. How tf they’re so fast in taking spikes
Dont do comps but something I’ve always felt happy about is getting better hs% so from E5: A3 to now it went up from 8% to 18% not amazing but feels nice knowing it’s my first fps an all
I think you’re being pedantic when I’m trying to help you and if you do something faster that implies less time. Get downvoted to oblivion
My favorite one on Haven is the wall bang in sewers for the right side B post plant. It’s so unexpected and nasty.
Yessir
Set it to Private, and you get the whole map to yourself, and can pick any power level

(You used to be able to do this at least, don't know if they changed it)
The worst part is that even when it's down in a good spot, people don't play their position to defend it. They plant default but have no idea why it's usually planted there and just post up randomly. On breeze A site for example, they plant for shop then post up in anything goes spots. Then they even peek it before they are tapping (giving up position and sometimes dieing) then end up getting killed when they could have just chilled, let them fake it for a second, then peek and see. I feel like in CS for example, if a plant goes down Inferno a site(default), they will play pit or apartments and only peek if they have to. No reason to check if they 1 haven't started defuse and 2 don't know where you are. Even if your position is obvious and they cleared the rest. Almost always playing the bomb usually will win the round in delay. Idk why some people take the fight and die when there is no reason to commit if you have advantage. Sorry about the rant.(I know it's not true for all, but I see this a lot)
30 right now hoping that’s me in 20 years haha
Oh right because a team based game it really only comes down to you individually as a singular person. For sure.
It's literally so easy for someone who exists to purely play valorant 12 hours a day to say this lol
Hiding your information gives less info to enemy players, which could be a small benefit in ranked.
yep it sure is and I'm not giving up till i find a sealed one
I feel like when you're about to play these kind of games, you need to expect all of the flame and things like that knowing it's a competitive games with voice chat and you need to be ready mentally for all of that. If you afraid to use your mic in game for any reason except you can't afford a mic, rather not play this kind of competitive games tbh because info is such an important thing
You have a clip?
Unfortunately you just have to focus on yourself, and make sure you’re playing the best you can. Obviously give comms. People may not talk, but they’ll hear your comms. Eventually you get used to the back and forth games.
Consistency is one of the points against high sensitivity...
This has been me in every game the last 5~ years.
Missing Crosshair Profiles

We're aiming to stop your crosshair profiles from disappearing with a fix on **Patch 8.09**, though this update will not *restore* your crosshair profiles.

thats what´s shown on the riot support page
India (Asia)
You know it'll be the same experience in other modern shooters though, right? The difference is that (outside of DM), getting 1 tapped or beamed is more memorable because you have to just sit there and watch someone else play the game if you die. 

Go play Apex as a new player and queue. You'll be dead within the first 3 minutes. CoD? Yeah you're getting fucked destroyed in pub lobbies as a new player.

Shooters are *never* a forgiving genre for new players because things like map knowledge, movement, playing the right angles, etc provide a massive advantage over anyone who doesn't know how to use them.
I ain't saying u need to be VERY good, but in most servers Asc and immortals are more chill than irons and bronzes.
[removed]
no, but i would ask either the battle royale subreddit or the comepeteive fortnite subreddit 

r/FortNiteBR r/FortniteCompetitive
You're right in the fact that you can't ignore her once she's in. But the point is she instantly takes contact and dies within 3 seconds of the entry, via a swing out or a spam. You're almost always in a bad position after the combo and defenders can easily contact. And once the Jett gets so far ahead of her teammates after the combo   defenders can easily make that contact without the risk of a trade. Ascent A Generator is a good example, you smoke dash in on that side, Jett takes contact from the Gen player or/and the Garden Door player, I swing that almost always if a Jett tries that spot for the combo.
It happens literally every day on all NA servers. You’re either playing in a stack, not talking, or not a girl.
you completed valorant
Yup totally agree. Got over 7k hours in dota. Val community toxicity is literally a walk in the garden.
Broken for a few weeks, nerfed into oblivion so hard that he turns into todd howard’s IP?
So the ennemy does mot get a notification when I see them unless I reveal them ? Does the reveal dart act like a projectile as in you can see the direction it came from ?
64 tick makes CS:GO feel like it's purposely missing all my shots in order to sabotage me. I swear to god I could confidently perfectly spray 30 bullets into a guy who's crouching completely still and still somehow miss every bullet while my perfect recoil goes into a state of disarray and the bullets start disappearing. Gunplay has never felt worse than on 64 tick. The difference, to me, is so major I shit on faceit lvl 8-9 while I struggle against the worst LE players ive seen in my life on 64 tick. its so unbelievably bad
Duplication glitch. Most of which have been patched, all if I'm correct. But there was a mass of players duplicating their inventories and passing them around. Whether this be 144 maxed traps, weapons or even building and crafting materials. Huge impact on stonework. Mainly because all those stoneys don't even know how to play. They got a 130 and they think they are goated. Little do they know, there's nothing to brag about .. ( "woo-hoo, Someone gave you overpowered stuff so you can smash through everything with no progression and lose interest in the game. So sooo fun..." ) . Like, what goes through these people's minds honestly. But yeah, Lil rant haha. My main point is that having all that given to you in any game... it ruins it, the progression, the anticipation to do better and qork harder to get better. All that eliminated because someone dropped a bunch of duplicated gear.. sad times
The thing is I have my mouse pre-aimed at head level and they instantly crouch so I need to readjust my crosshair lower, but by then I'm dead cos they shoot my body and my legs which slows down my movement
Hope so
Makes sense, that should balance it out pretty well.
I finally spent some money on a skin about a week ago. It was only 10$,but i had an ion vandal in my night market so that was why. I definitely dont plan on buying another skin soon,and im definitely not going to buy any skin thats not in the night market

I’d recommend doing the shooting range on medium until you can hit 15/30 consistently, when I hit that threshold I climbed my way from the depths of iron
yea but just maybe, if so many ppl talk about if, they’ll nerf it someday
This is the answer, turning comms off before the game starts should be either not be possible or bannable. It's throwing.

You're not. There's plenty of other modes you can play with your friends
Excluding situations where people get boosted by teammates, the only stat you should worry about is win%
Damn much love but console Val looks fucking boring
all weapons are good if you have a good setup
Baiting is huge in Valo xd
The pace of the game is also weirdly more snooze then im CS even tho Valorant could be way faster
I'm a year younger than her then

I don't hide it here or ow. First reason is because I didn't know you could. Second reason is I've barely seen anyone talk about levels in this game. Only ranks.
In my 20 years of gaming I can say that is genuinely the worst feature iv ever encountered from a gaming studio, looks like I won’t be playing this game ever again
Quit. You get better but u won’t rank up unless you have the mental to sit and play 12 hours a day. It’s not a skill thing it’s a mental thing. Game is pointless and u get nothing out of it unless u simply want to prove to urself u can beat the mental game
just play the game more, once the experience kicks in you'll be better at handling enemy util
Are you f#ing retar?ded?
Both breeze and split are great maps tbh
Got two knives, but nebula and xenohunter (i have the xerøfang knife)
It's left over tier 6 mats the devs planned on adding, they are useless and just take up space in your inventory. It's best to just get rid of them since you can't do anything with it, plus they are duped to hell by other players.
the gun itself is technically not rare, you can just ask someone who had it to drop it to you and they'll most likely have them to spare thanks to duping or having way too many mats so they can craft bazillions, but the schemantic is, specially because since 2020 you cant even get founders anymore, hell im trying to save for the regular founders pack that rn is like 300 dollars in code selling websites
I broke $2k when i bought the new bundle. I have almost 2000 hours on the game at this point and genuinely enjoy it. Haven't regretted a single skin or bundle i've purchased which i can't say about anything else.
I know I am??
I think bronze is a pretty normal rank to start at. Most of my friends debuted at either iron or bronze. I started at gold, but that's because I was scared of ranked at first and stuck to unrated until long after I knew what I was doing. If I'd jumped into comp as soon as I could, I'm sure I would have been iron.
If one of you cherrypicks my post one more time, then I'm just going to block the lot of you.
OUR beloved.
Like Ludwig!
Yeah it was exactly same with me when I was in iron
don't
no
This is also exactly why the assists statistic exists, lol..
Do DMs and some aim routine (10-15min a day) focus in headshot and dont rush your shots in the beginning. 

In competitive, take more space and fight harder for space on the map. Play more aggressive and do some vod review, only watch when you die and see what you did wrong there. 

GL!!
I feel like I encounter more kids the higher up I climb. Used to play with my ex and was hardstuck silver during that time, mostly playing bronze/silver due to her rank. 99% of players I met were adults. Now I'm in gold/plat lobbies and half of the players are kids...
All I'm saying is I've got a 81% winrate on breeze with neon
The issue is that there aren’t 5-6 maps that everyone loves. But tbh the issue with some maps is you have to play retake if you playing weak side and not everyone has comms or team coordination
Yes
The best practice is to always com yourself. Idk if this applies to you specifically, but some people that complain about people not comming are also quiet oj the mic. If you want people to talk you need to get the conversation going.
Odd. On PS5, this just came about within the past week or so. Prior to that it wasn't an issue. Thanks for the response.
I need an xbox one for UK? Any chance you got a spare 
Penis means the same in english too??
That Omen smoke positioning gave away your rank.
Seems like it
Wind foliage is all that matters
they dont sell founder packs since 2020.  


also, what kind of thinking is that? take away guns from battle royale and the player base would drop off a cliff 🤓☝️
Check out her profile. She fakes her cosplays by putting her face on other people's pictures. I didn't find the original of this one, but it is most likely fake. She doesn't do cosplays, just promotes her OF
stop before shooting and moving while resetting recoil and stop before shooting again

simple and easy
Good! That what i need
Yep. It feels just like CS. 64 Tick and bad tracer/blood
S3, whole gold, and like plat1/2. That’s just my experience.

Just because it's "there" doesn't mean it's ready for a region. This is a completely new platform for Valorant, expecting a worldwide release from a limited beta is a bit much. Be glad that console Valorant even exists.
What

The fact people are already bending to this half wall glitch garbage is just laughable. Probably would yell at you too if you changed the walls.

I dropped to a consistent 5 fps for a whole mission. Epic doesn't know what their doing.
Raze, that rocket is just not okey
I love it. Might be biased tho cuz I made my first ace with it yesterday
Huh? I don’t know anyone with a comms ban
I've been kinda back and forth about this. When I was total noob I preferred full shield quite heavy. Then I tried to ease into being comfortable with light shields before outlaw came out. This pushed me to favour full shields again, but for the last months I have mainly gone light shields again.

My heuristic for figuring out the buy is usually based on targeting the next round minimum at 3300 for vandal and light. If I can get full shield this round without the next round min dropping under that then I get full shield.

It is pretty common to be in a situation where you have the money to buy vandal plus light on 2 rounds back to back, but if you go full this turn you lose alot on the next because 600 is alot.
Average Jonas says yes

i mean, its impossible to give u a personalized reason as to why when i havent seen how u play. 

but for example, i had a friend who just recklessly pushed CT when he was on attack after planting spike. he was playing brim. i simply told him to stop doing that. plant spike, then fall back and play like ur on defense now and not attack. guy instantly went up from bronze to gold. that was the change. 

ofc, situations are always a bit nuanced. maybe my friend had enough aim to be gold, or whatever, but he held himself back with bad habits. some ppl have things they need to remove from their skill set, some have things they need to add. but ur aproach to rounds is what matters. its what makes u a better player. aim and mechanics really arent that important. id say it comes with the whole package. theres plenty of silver players that are good aimers, but have no clue how to actually play the game.
thx bro
95% haven’t even unlocked him, and even if they did, it would take a few months for people to get used to him
So I have to ask, why are there so many quests showing, when at the bottom left i can only access like 2? will they be available later?
I like it firm too
Yup it’s so boring that all my friends are playing Roblox, Minecraft, and OSRS. (Including me)
Because its low ranks and most people would rather just try to clutch.
Bro they should really remove split and breeze from the map pool and bring back icebox fracture and pearl
I hope this doesn't come off as too elitist or whatever, but at that point why bother playing? I used have horrendous packet loss every once in a while, spikes in the range of 70% - 90%, and that made the game basically unplayable. Did I force my friends and teammates to deal with sometimes just not having a fifth member of their team? Nah, I just played singleplayer and waited for stuff to come back on in a way that worked. I've always been fine on hardware so can't speak on that much, but how do people even enjoy the game at that low of framerate, or on a trackpad? My laptop trackpad doesn't even get recognized by the game, I HAVE to use the mouse. 

And beyond all that, if you have all these issues, why bother to play competitive when there's plenty of other modes that work just as well?
more patient than Gandi
idk what rank u are but don’t sweat abt double controller. ik i’m just a diamond pleb but i refuse to believe that u need double smokes even in immo. if ur friends aren’t familiar with smokes, i rlly wouldn’t suggest just blindpicking double controller just bc it’s rlly good. it takes a lot of practice and coordination.
This low ass crosshair placement 🤨
I no longer had the drive in me to keep up with everyone in CS. Valorant was an easy game. Plus it’s a lot more friendly to new players and my friends who could never be convinced to play CS started playing Val. Also, CS matchmaking is absolute dog water
In asc my teammates tell me to use the odin when I go double negative with rifles xd it's just banter don't worry about it
raze is sooooooooooo annoying on sunset. i'm surprised she doesn't have a 100% pickrate on it.
I'm not sure that I am suppose to answer you or they are but here are my thoughts with survivors:

\-Most players I know and myself use them to get trap durability up for endurances, so they stack them with at least 4 trap durability and 1 set of trap damage or you can go all trap durability with one left over and choose but you don't get full benefits of matching this way.

\-If you are not an endurance runner then others use it to max out damage for storm king: melee damage and some ranged weapon damage.

\-After that then it is just a experiment if you are into it and recycle for training manuals if needed.
Never surrender
Some folks were asking about it yesterday. I haven’t encountered it though.
Holy shit
Guess you are going to have to play solos for the next 8000 years.
Probably like ascendant or better since it's around 5% of players
I don't think it's a problem, I play on a high sens too (3200 DPI, 0.753) and I enjoy it. Whatever works for you.

More people wanting to play her and fill smokes is a good thing for ranked play

bit of an over reaction dont u think?
You act like people with no util are useless bruh they have guns
Nvm then lol
sure if you don't need them i could use it
You can message me back and I’ll show you I dmed you
why the heck would you need to do a 360 degree turn, this aint cod.

You shouldn't even fall much into situations that requires you to do a 180 degree turn.

Only you knows what sens is right.
cool
Looks awesome! You got the details DOWN! :)
Smurfs makes riot games money so they aren't very interested in solving the problem, i personally just stopped complaining about smurfs and just focusing on myself and after a while it got me from silver to ascendant, complaing about smurfs isn't going to help much so focus on yourself and your own skill and youll naturally see yourself get better

been my "pit stop" for 4 rank up games, almost a year, and insane loss streaks
i like it so much, nice work!
Damn why didn’t I read  comment a few hours ago rip
Whenever i think my team would lose the 2nd round, i  never buy out coz u will just be giving ur weapons to the enemy team......and u won't be able to buy in the 3rd round...
Boxes are so common but you can always to boxes on A and repositioning to heaven, hell, tree. There are all those doors on mid to tp on and when attacking you can make a one way near market and tp on top too
Can’t send dm
This is what it feels like trying to play a black metal loadout with randoms.
It sure got repaired
shutup u aint gon tell him what to DO
well ted can be flux and jelly t need voucher . not sure

so beter ted then, cheaper
Can I have a PS code if you aren’t using it please???
D2 19 at most and 15 on average
Stinger is great for characters with more expensive loadouts. I play a lot of chamber and getting his bullets 2nd round with a stinger force works out fine.
Yeah its bugged at the moment, if you start seeing the tracers while having them off, turn them on and then off again and it fixes it temporarily
You seem to want as few impactful abilities as possible. Abilities are a huge part of the game. Agents like Reyna are literally the worst designed agents in the game because they completely oppose the game's design philosophy surrounding abilities and team play. It sounds like the type of utility you want is closer to a game like csgo than valorant.
You’re reformulating it in how you want it to sound, everyone else gets what they mean by it
Personally I hate the whole shocked face stuff in thumbnails, but if that helps you get more views then go for it.
Bruh what the hell
Kayo isn’t my main but he’s def my favorite character. Purely because he’s a robot
Nope that's not the reason
Forget about it buddy.
that literally means no vandal and phantom in the game, or to have 3 specters to choose from.
It's one thing to having a laugh at or about terrible builds... it's another matter to point out the stupidity in people ACTIVELY ignoring advice or suggestions to build appropriately for the conditions.

I don't give a flying fuck how someone puts together a build in all honesty, i've seen some seriously screwed up shit, but i draw the line at building with brick in water missions or metal in nature or wood in fire. I also draw the line at throwing up cannon ball launchers facing outwardly toward nothing, or tire/ceiling traps one tile high....

I've had now 2 dozen or more, started losing count, missions in ventures alone, in which players are building exclusively out of brick, doesn't matter what their real powerlvl is... pwlvl144 players even. And when i ask why, i get purely toxic responses or just blatant hostility. That's if i get an answer at all. I'm fully willing to educate those not in the know, but for fucks sakes, at least be willing to accept a little criticism.

[The dumbest thing i heard today was trying to claim "powercreep" for their reasoning to use brick.](https://i.imgur.com/5nY3uyd.jpg) What a load of bullshit, when a water smasher breaths on a multi constructor base brick wall that's tier 3, even with the flag planted, it goes down. Suggesting power creep as the reason to even build with brick intentionally is delusional, since even with all the improvements and skills and shit we have, it doesn't stop it getting toppled.

I've been in numerous missions where "oh it'll be fine.... we've got this" has ended in utter destruction defeat. I stick around to call them out on it since hey i've got the time to burn, i'm in no panic or rush... They think i'm complaining or "whining" when i'm mostly just there to be entertained when the shit hits the fan, it's no loss to me really, specially when i have the rule of contributing as little to building when they insist on using the weakest material to build with and absolutely refuse to do anything about it, even to make up bullshit excuses...
Forgot abt my goat dire and hybrid
Deadzoning is shooting in between strafes. Counter-strafing is tapping opposite directional inputs to instantly zero movement velocity. Counter-strafing is important in CSGO because velocity carries after you let go of the movement key. It's negligible in Valorant because velocity zeroes very quickly after you let go of the A/D key. Conversely, deadzoning is important in Valorant because it makes you a harder target to hit, whereas it's not really a thing in CSGO.
r/fortnite just lean into it
I usually just try to meow or “uwu” or whatever my jett needs me to do so he can perform.
My story is very much the same but i'm not good at Valorant or any competitive esport so i better study lol
Well actually, if you have a vandal everyone’s a one shot
Maybe ur audio settings is set to mono and not stereo
I would kill someone to get these as loading screens. I didn’t even know some of these existed.
Favorite would be either Bind or Split. Least favorite is Lotus and it isn't even close. I honestly think it is one of the worst maps in any FPS game I've ever played. I loathe that map.
I’ve played Save the World for almost five years so it’s definitely not my first time around, I’m just bad at the game lol
And I feel that it is honestly really good
I would’ve been surprised if you didn’t feel the 0.01 difference on 4400 dpi 😅
This is not the right subreddit but still, this occurs due to epic changing your epic id or name due to it being inappropriate or that it does not align with epic's rules. Just go change your name, it's completely free l
You need to be better than the people in your lobbies. If you play well individually, you will lose less RR when you lose and gain more when you win. I just started playing ranked again a week or two ago, and I'm on average doing pretty well. Last night I played 6 games of which my team lost 4. I still gained RR overall, because I was getting about 30 on a win and on my losses I was losing as little as 12 in one case. When you combine that with the fact that on average you should win about half your games - that's how you claw your way out of the lower ranks.
Had similar experience but they instantly went from "fuck you!" to "OH nice trade" lol
Reyna and Jett I literally can't just use them 
Wanted to try them cause they are like the most used duelist, Jett was kinda okay but Reyna is just no
but they wouldn't easily spend it with us 🥺
I started with 0. I don’t know why or how. I feel your pain 😭
Smurfs suck and shouldn't be allowed in any game IMO. It's like taking an MLB player and throwing them in a little league match, of course they're going to stomp.
No worries. If you're NA and need coaching I enjoy playing with and helping new players if you want help. If not, that's okay too and I can try to answer any questions you have.
Honestly I’d say if you work on crosshair placement and good movement (counter strafing, jiggle peaks etc.) I think you could easily carry lobbies up until silver. Valorant was my first fps game and I started at rock bottom. I just remember flying through those ranks just by working on those little things.
Close your eyes
It's painfully gorgeous, nothing compares to its beauty. But, STW clearly wasn't in mind when they designed it. Its so unbelievably glitchy.
I don’t have it loud asf ever mostly just ambiance that scratches my brain
Why do folks hate fracture? It’s so fun!
I really want to play her but Omen blind is just so good T_T
The problem is not instalocking, it’s that most of the people who instalock then expect everyone else to pick a good comp around their instalock. Idc if you want to instalock reyna but don’t start crying that we have no smokes 30 seconds later.
Why trash talk ennemies when you can be nice and friendly instead? They are Humans too...
Ah yeah could be him then. Nice sleuthing lol

My guess is around gold. High elo players aren't as brave as you, I'm guessing gold because it doesn't seem like the enemy team is punishing you for what should've been a mistake on your part.

That being said, i don't think this is enough to give you any hard hitting advice. You should upload a vod of an entire game because we don't see you in full context.
No, was on London servers lol

Report all of them and explain in one line how they are sabotaging the team, then let the stupid rounds go by. It won't be long anyway.

Also, if needed, mute them all.
So what? Thats similar to the concept of consumption. I'm sure you've spent more money consuming things(that aren't necessary) that dont exist forever either. 

Atleast with skins you get a "return" on investment, which is, seeing your skin everytime you play the game.

I get where you're coming from and I understand why viper could be misunderstood as a harder skill ceiling than harbor but she's not really that complicated, a viper ( in double Controller because single Controller she's straight ass ) main job is to keep control/deny space/info from the enemy team, a good viper has maximum 2 setups a map. as the meta already defined what u need to control ( for example A main on split, A lobby on Haven etc. ) 

Harbor is a different beast, not only do u need to understand how your primary smokes is playing, but u also need to perfect ur wall EVERY TIME or ur site exec is gone down the drain as if u leave any small gap ur fucked. Harbor also doesn't have the ability to put down his wall like viper, u put ur wall, no more walls for 40 seconds. ( unless u have a cascade ) so timing wise is really strict for harbors.
Not my video. Just sharing it. Apparently the owner changed permissions.

i guess youl have to stick with yule trooper and jack osassin
Yeah my peak with 75hz was immo but even upgrading to 144hz made me a "better" player. It was like I could take a step through my screen, a lot smoother, and I reacted a lot faster.
This is the answer. I can play Valo so little and keep a high rank.


Also, I feel like people without kids don't realize how easy kids go to bed, lol. Mine are down at 745ish every night. 
Hi. For context I didn't played since a long time, maybe I'm unnaware of some change that could have happened in ranked.

I started playing again recently and I ended up Plat 2 after my placement games (which is a fraud, I'm not at all this level anymore).

I play few more games (3, as you can see) and end up directly Diamond? Wtf happened?
you can float from nest to yellow i think.
I would say there is a chance they might introduce some feature in the future that lets you gain access to old battle pass skins, but it would have to be further down the road when there are a lot more battle passes released.

But for the foreseeable future, yes, they are not coming back.
"The technology just isn't there yet"
I would recommend not trading or accepting any gifted weapons with a high powerlevel to not ruin the experience with the game
Go to spacial sound(search spatial sound in start) and go to device properties and set spatial sound to off.
Somebody pin this
How can I use reward points to buy skins?
If only you had a Bow that could shoot through walls...
that's a nonsense
I think it could work like a KJ turret with some degree based vision so someone could potentially sneak behind it, else could be too strong
Ohhh 
Should have atleast one person on Marshall, or outlaw for anti eco, they can take the long range fight.
Have you encountered Reyna players. 

When I was grinding to my peak (plat 2) you would not believe the shit they say. And just hope they aren't top fragging. You won't hear the end of it.
I mean this in the least mean way possible but it’s literally because we have better stuff than you and can actually handle the waves relatively easily compared to someone at or less than the rated PL of the mission

Tenz the eternal GOAT
So if you queue in a 3 stack, they will prioritize matching you with another 3 stack on the enemy team. This will skew the matchmaking as they only have a limited number of 3 stacks to match you with. 

As lundagnan said, if you give point values to each rank ie iron 1 = 1 point; Iron 2 = 2 points; and so on you get a total for your team of 48 points and the enemy team is 47 points. 

Your team is also a majority of gold (2 golds and a plat) while the other teams majority is silver. Look at the average rank for each team, yours being gold and theirs is in silver. 

The 3 stack on their team is probably at least 2 of the silvers so they gave them some golds to match your golds, and they gave you bronzes to make up for your plat player and lower the average rank to the other teams average rank. 

The worst player in the game was the gekko on the other team. So while the bronze players weren’t carrying you guys (they shouldn’t) they performed well enough in a higher rated lobby that I don’t think they should shoulder any blame. They played well enough for you guys to win. 

By every metric your team is better. Yoru probably cost the game as he is the highest rated player and had the lowest KAST%


TLDR since you 3 man queued they matched you up against a most likely silver 3 man team as they might not have had a gold 3 man team for to go against. Then they had to manipulate the average ranks and give them better players and you worse players to make it a fair game.
Nature's a really weird name for them to have gone with tbf. Everything about it just screams electricity, and "nature" is usually more associated with grass and greenery
Wrong sub

Sick asf
What agents do you play? Hs percentage doesn’t mean ur a bad shot.
you'd be surprised how little fuck people give about you in general. 
not trying to be mean, people just don't care about others; they've got their own lives to care about.
Ah the good ole days of the 6 hour timers on missions
My biggest pet peeve is people getting annoyed/mad at you or mocking you for giving comms in ranked. Like the “bro it’s not that deep” or “why are you trying so hard” people. 

Yeah, at the end of the day it’s just the game. But at the same time, at the end of the day it’s a *tactical* shooter and you’re playing the *competitive* game mode. If you just wanna lock Duelist and go no comms, then why not play Unrated?

It was bad enough when I was climbing and even happens in mid elo like Plat and Diamond but I see this shit constantly now that I got placed into Silver after the rank reset.
I don't think so, the rapier skin was popular but popular because it was a decent enough battlepass skin, the only way I see riot making another rapier skin is if the community really wants it but I don't see that happening.
So whats the problem then? Just mute all the toxic people and enjoy your game.
They got some good meatballs though

Am I stupid or are you still iron
Sheriff and Marshal. Very fun to use guns imo and really satifsying when I got a kill on these guns.
if you sprint around with a spectre and just spray, you need castrating.
Right but I think you’re missing the point, players at this level won’t make sense of layouts. How can a new player who doesn’t know which map Haven is, figure out if Sova is good on the map after learning the layout. And those who do know (like yourself I’m guessing) can remedy this problem by spending 5 min outside the game “studying” the map names. Most players will remember the names after 5-10 games anyway.
i feel the same way..i was plat 1 now im silver 3. but like play spike rush or swiftplay
same im asking for further assistance but still waiting for a response

Ive been solo queueing since beta, I don't get the privilege of a duo
This is the newbie sage we all encounter
This made me LOL 🤣👍🏼
thats a fast way to burnout. also if you wanna improve at the game, you SHOULD NOT be playing 10 games a day unless you wanna go semi/pro.
I have the same issue here except I am not sure what I’m doing wrong… I entry for my teammates as Reyna, smoke as Omen and play 2 agents, crosshair placement is good, tracker rating is pretty decent, headshot percentage is pretty good, KDA is on top 3.2%. I don’t know what I am doing wrong although maybe gamesense is holding me back?
Clove sounds right for you. You have smokes (even after death) and you can take gunfights, heal yourself and decay the enemy.
>If you can only hit bodyshots with a vandal then there is absolutely no reason why sheriff only will change that.

False. Not having auto fire will make me line up head shots.
Origin Vandal sucks. My first and only skin for vandal. Wish I just bought glitchpop and waited for it to appear in my shop.
Hate breach love the players
I have a code for ps5 if any1 need
In my experience both in valo and dota (played with the same trash talking friend in both games), a lot of it is down to thinking they should be placed in a higher rank. 

They think that they’re playing perfectly and everyone else isn’t. Even when I was 4k mmr in dota and my friend was 1.6k, he still somehow thought he was objectively the same level of skill as I was. Some dudes just have no self awareness and take it out on everyone else
The same advantage works with chamber Jett and reyna just impossible to trade. The only difference is iso can’t get away.
No where close lol
You can’t stop me from mollying my teammate in swift play !!!!!
its so sad like you werent invited to whatever they were tripping on

Paladins is really not necessary with aim and I’m a high plat/low diamond player. One major switch I saw when I started playing val more is that aim is a skill that you need to have in lower Elo’s compared to aim being a differing factor in higher elo’s in paladins. It’s just 2 completely different type of fps games

Yeah especially when they reduce the game size
Valorant isn't a MOBA. Every single agent can be one tricked to radiant if you are good enough. The differences in agents are very minor and at the end of the day, mastery over a single agent is way more powerful than relying on the raw power of an unmastered agent. Just find agents/roles you like and play to get better.
This game has like 100k concurrent players if I m not wrong after knowing that I don't even blame match making just accept it 😂
I found the fix for it 😊 go into your settings and go to the mic button and on the bottom click open voice settings. Make sure voice reporting is set to off when possible. Then on voice chat turn it off and then back on to everybody. Save the setting and turn your console/pc/switch completely off. Turn it back on when it’s ready and that should fix it. I did this to my pops PS5 and my PC and it fixed both of ours. Took my PC like two times but it did fix it ☺️☺️. Hope this helps!!
I get what you are saying, i guess i just read it more angrily than it sounds..... I didn't know about that system either.......
Same thing! I formatted my computer and worked for a bit and now it's doing the same thing.
[removed]
Yes, it's hugely important. But only for extremes.

If you're on 800 dpi 3 sens, playing on some 4 cm anime tiddy mousepad, you're actively hindering your aiming ability. It doesn't matter if you find it comfortable, you're objectively playing a bad sens.

But if you're comparing something like 0.2 or 0.3 nah shit don't matter just use what you feel best on.
just don’t pick it up.
ah yes

the mysterious orb that we dont even know the function of

smokes that are usable POSTMORTEM

and an overheal that doesnt require los, just a tap and you get the overheal

not to mention a full on self rez, not the pheonix yone e but an actual "i want to come back now" self rez

exactly what part of this kit is copied from another agent? the methodology of how she places her smokes? because i honestly wish my controllers had brim style smokes, its my favorite way of placing them

tdm doesnt improve map awareness, neither improves util usage. Swiftplay is good for learning the game but unrated is the way to go for economy management. Watching some videos of Konpeki can get you around the basics. DONT PAY FOR ANY COACHING RELATED TO VALORANT. Everything is free on the internet just search for it. After you hit Platinum, i would also recommend buying a Vandal or Phantom skin depending on your preference because it has a GOOD placebo effect.
Logitech G305
it‘s only about 40$ and got the hero-sensor plus lightspeed wireless connectivity.

why pay 140$+ for a mouse, when you get one for 40$ with same or even better quality?
Depend from situations and the team, can be save, sherif or half-buy
A bit of a shameless plug but here we go.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/170eln3/can\_someone\_help\_me\_fill\_the\_controller\_class/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/170eln3/can_someone_help_me_fill_the_controller_class/)

I'm making a guide that helps players how to decide the optimal play of a given situation. But since it is still in early development, I've only gotten the agent roles part completed.

If you are too lazy to read the image or it's too hard on the eyes for you. Then I'll give you the summary.

If you want a duelist who is self-sufficient and is not dependent on a decent initiator, then Reyna or Phoenix would be good for you. However, they are a bit too selfish and do not lack the 'desired' duelist that most team players want at a higher level... but honestly, who cares, this is rank, everyone suc anyway.

If you want the 'meta' duelist, then Jett, Raze, and Neon are great choice since they excel at what most high-level team wants out of a duelist, which is to get space. However, raze is an agent that needs consistent practice, so Jett and Neon is your best fit for this.

Yoru... unless you really like lurking or outplaying the enemy or just like his kit. I suggest don't. It's not that he is bad. Pro players are actually starting to use him a lot... (or was it already months ago? Idk man, I don't follow tournaments at all.)

The reason I don't suggest Yoru is because he is easy to learn but hard to master at a conceptual level. And the game needs you to be a master at it and not half-assed the agent.

&#x200B;

***So TLDR:***

Phoenix & Reyna if you want to be self sufficient / jack of all trades.

Jett & Neon if you want an agent that well... excels at doing duelist job. But do requires assitance from your team.
17 rr is good, i get like 12-14 max
Thought I was agreeing with the commenter I replied to. Explaining my thoughts that even on defense, his more advantageous side, he isn’t broken like OP suggests. Guess I didn’t explain well
nothing matter  
it's just a rank
Ain't no one here imm3 stop the cap

Thank you for your thoughtful comment and for raising valid concerns about the potential biases in the study design. I appreciate the opportunity to address these points and provide further clarity. I have also been curious about the effect of my performance in a prior game's lobby on the average rank of the next game's lobby, which is why I have tracked the average rank of the lobby (easily retrieved in Valorant Tracker's match history).

The rationale behind using an alternating sequence of colors (None, Yellow, Red, Purple) was to control for the practice effect and ensure that each color was tested under similar conditions. By rotating the colors in a consistent order every game, the aim was to distribute any improvements in performance due to warming up, increased familiarity with the game, the mode, maps, and weapons evenly across all colors.

To address the potential impact of the matchmaking algorithm on the results, I analyzed the relationship between my performance in the previous game and the rank of the next lobby. The data from the spreadsheet shows a weak correlation (r = -0.1255, with a p-value of 0.2255.) between my K/D ratio in the previous game and the average rank of the next lobby. This suggests that my performance in one game had little influence on the difficulty of the subsequent lobby, reducing the likelihood of the matchmaking algorithm confounding the results.

However, I acknowledge that the study's sample size is limited, and the findings should be interpreted with caution. The purpose of this post and the call to action is to expand the study's scope and gather more data from a larger and more diverse group of participants. By increasing the sample size, we can improve the reliability and generalizability of the results.

Furthermore, I appreciate your suggestion of randomizing the order of the highlight colors for each game to minimize potential biases. In designing the next phase of the study, I will consider randomly assigning participants to different groups with varying color sequences or randomly selecting the highlight color for each match.
Low elo players might have one thing they are good at, and think it means they're good at the game.  Especially if their "thing" is aim, so they aren't even cognizant enough to realize how much of the game they are missing.
nah he’s out of the project after what happened last time lol.

the project is mostly handled by me now with other people working on the custom backend plus a game server is now in the works.
Even though this is the save the world sub. This glitch is fairly common it seems, even starting since the OG chapter a month ago. Unfortunately I can’t figure out how to get rid of it and it’ll pop up occasionally
I'm adding to this, this works for me but I'm not sure if it works for others. Round 2 even if I win or lose pistol round I always do light shields and a stinger depending on the map. The recoil is insanely easy to manipulate.
i got the entire valorant go vol 2 in my store all guns :(
My peak rank is only d3 so I can't help much. Valorant has variance. It sounds like you are trying to improve your own play, and that's all you can do. 
Maybe vod review and focus on minimizing rounds where you have no impact. 
If you've ever played league, it's common to need 100s of games to reach your "deserved" rank. Just keep playing and youll probably hit a win streak at some point.
prob clove
Way better ace then any Raze ace on here good shots
Yea autumn biome maps have this effect, i did an E&C on an autumn suburbs map yesterday and the first time the mobs spawned this also happened
I started playing valorant 3 years ago and I only played against a cheater once one year ago. He was only wallhacking.
Settings don't matter, stable 100 fps is all what you need
I just meant regular market
>So many clueless people keep echoing this garbage. Where did it even come from?

Huge influx of cheaters lately, and seemingly the match replay we were once promised is now supposedly a long ways away. 

They're literally just making bullshit excuses as to why it's not in the game right now. Despite what Anna Donlon is saying, it's actually isn't hard to implement a replay system or optimize it for a game as simple as Valorant. Especially since Riot is a billion dollar game company and they already have a match replay for LoL. Fuck me, the first Black Ops game had match replay and it's about 14 years old. Do you really expect people to believe that they can't add it to the game because it's "too hard"? Get real.
Big Smoke confirmed as next Controller.
If I get invited I’ll give u a code, if u don’t get a code
People don’t even want to stack a site/play retake when you lose pistol 90% of the time in dia-ascendant elo. Just valorant things tbh
Anybody has a Ps5 code I’m kinda desperate 30mins after codes should be sent out
Tunnels / Planning / Defenders 

Honestly Farrah is a DPS Machine, I use that loudout in every zone
That is true from a purely economic point of view, I don't see an issue with people people being upset at Riot over it though. They're getting all the money from a small percentage of whales that buy a lot of skins, while most of the playerbase will only be able to enjoy maybe a couple because of the price. It's prioritizing their income (which is reasonable) but if you disagree then that's a reasonable thing to be upset about too.
Based on the info I could see you trying to tp heaven to get out or doing your smoke play. Both feel completely fine. Only exception would be if your team has a great ult for retake (Kayo/KJ) or the tp wasn’t feasible because the enemy scaled too far.
"You'd never survive a CoD lobby" is such a silly thing to say. Like ok, these are toxic, and? It ain't good lmao
Because I only play against bronzes.
thats tough, currently reworking my view and mindset to the game and it's quite challenging to change when you're taking a game seriously
SEA server is a terrible experience.

sure, will do

Would Kay/O be a sort of argument to be had about vs Omen or would the Omen pick just overall win it?
I acctually use insights capture and do this,I was able to improve alot because of it cause it helped me over come habits like crouch spraying unnecessarily.
He looks really fun , I think he will be good in ranked for a lot of people. Doubt we will see him in comp scene (that doesn’t matter to most people but maybe does if you’re a pro enjoyer). He won’t be a character I lean towards as I know for a fact I will ult people and get laid out everytime :)
Goodluck on your climb to radiant.
Aww man I love my daily login rewards
Bro, before you decide buying this:  
\*You only get 29.2k vbucks per year (80 vbucks per day minimum)  
\*You could use that money to get instantly 67.5k vbucks - $450  
\*To repay this, you'd need to play every single day for about 2.3 years  
After all of that,  it's technically a profit.  
But please only buy this if you're actually going to play the game, because it's not worth it
This game has one of the best lores imho
Yeah it's a pretty shit ability i don't know why people are defending it when iso as an agent is overall shit too
Usually i am very confident in my aim, usually i lose duels because of timing. Bad peeking timings, killed through smokes, enemy peeks when I looked away etc.
It was not pay2win enough.

Seriously.
Me too but the problem comes from the duo ngl
Regulations will consider tradies who likely use their own tools for personal projects. So there's probably some reasonable overlap/precedent.
I just had the same issue but I can't find the right media pack on: [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/media-feature-pack-list-for-windows-n-editions-c1c6fffa-d052-8338-7a79-a4bb980a700a](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/media-feature-pack-list-for-windows-n-editions-c1c6fffa-d052-8338-7a79-a4bb980a700a)

It only goes op to 22H2 but my system runs on 23H2
Enemy voice lines are more agressive because you're their enemy. Friendly voice lines are just mesnt to tell you your teammate used the ult. Enemy voice lines are meant to tell you gtfo
Totally not cause the name of this sub is fortnite and people who dont play stw would assume its just a general fortnite sub
If u hold wide angle u gonna miss jiggle peeks. Best is to hold small and flick a wide swing.

Also hold slightly higher if u expect a jump peek.
so basically they admit their rank is not a rank but just a grind mechanic, that's not a disaster, that's just figuring out that their whole system is bullshit and rank is just that, bullshit hence proving my point.
can you dm me a xbox code please

Spray is predictable for Phantom and Vandal, go to the range and watch the bullet spread after the first 3-5 shots, always *pretty much* the same. But I'd avoid spraying where possible yes.
I cannot think of a single instance in which I would be able to use this “retaking” - to use the Split wall you need to literally on site already, nobody has time to do a wall lineup during a retake clutch when you’re already that close to site. It’s a cool concept you’ve found but I feel it would be better implemented at the beginning of rounds to lull enemies into a false sense of security around certain angles being inaccessible - i.e. f
i would also check out if you can raise survivor team levels but idk if you’re up to that in stone wood
she needs a father figure on the field
oh mb it’s for stw
started iron 1 in beta now radiant for the last 6 acts😎
They really nerfed BR XP earned in STW even dailies give 15K
0. Immortal 3. 

Aim is more crosshair placement, knowing how to clear angles, and game sense. Knowing where to look at a specific time and what the common angles are.

If you have to flick a lot or do the nutty TikTok clip stuff, you’re probably looking at the wrong places.q
The prismatic discharger had a rebalance a short while.
yeah you better not be the guy who killed me with a bucky only to come to reddit to gloat because then i’d be REALLY mad /s

You can’t afford a ghost and a wall
The scene is too young to tell right now. If Tenz continues to deliver and SEN win Madrid, he’ll probably be the first head on the Mt. Rushmore, but if Valorant continues to be a popular title for a decade someone undoubtedly will come along and dethrone his accomplishments/impact on the scene.

Considering how many bad maps there are in Valorant I'm starting to agree with this take. Just give us all the maps if absolute garbage like Icebox, Split and the new Breeze have to be played.

Nah I only just understood what they said at the end

They need kills for quests? 

“What about us who needs kills for our quests”

Nah that is absolute swamp dweller logic

Bros controller has stick drift, bros controller is most certainly covered in Cheeto dust

Bro probably last time he spoke to a fellow human was the ice age 

Bro don’t know :o
Your friend is a loser dude
Unfortunately not. Champs skins along with VCT skins are limited time only, around the events.
It’s a glitch. it’s from the battle royale Metallica event
And then the third smoke right ontop of the first one but slightly over lol.
I think it's a /s.
Right clicks only
Japanese servers also having problems. Just got kicked from my ranked game and can't reconnect.
i love you so much man 😭
Yea you can connect a MnK to your console to type in game chat. Don't let people gaslight you. There is actually a video of people doing it
You forgot the biggest point.

If I couldn’t go on my diamond smurf, I wouldn’t be able to play with my diamond ranked friend?
prime phantom, neptune vandal, and araxys vandal haven't gotten old for me. Absolutely love those skins.
The rank system is broken, even more so when they reset your ranks. I don't understand why you can just have people in your exact rank. If I'm g2 I should only be playing g2s, not even g3s or g1s
The map will often have some sort of names over places. Right angle corridors are usually elbow.

 Heaven is up a height (hell is underneath like in c haven). 

Baths/showers is some place (short) with tiles. 

CT is where defenders spawn (its short for counter terrorist) T spawn is terrorist/attacker spawn. 

Hard right/hard left is useful if someone is hiding flush against a corner

You don't need to know them all, you'll pick things up as you level up.
There is no one.
I got both champion vandal, the champ phantom, the arcane sheriff but i didn't buy the champ knives bc i didnt like them or already had one with similar or the same animation
The ones i like but didnt buy could still appear in my shop but i dont think im gonna spend money soon on the game
6 months what the fuck im going on 5 years
You clearly haven't seen how fast the pros flick to the orb
Why is no one talking about the fact that smurfing is not really a problem in valorant? you cant 1v5 in this game
Do you guys know if I can refund? If I bought a skin
I’m a bit out of the loop, what is FreightTrain?
We have Not Yet seen in further updates I think will they add
No, I felt like it was a ban speedrunner that's just spamming the same phrase within a post and a comment
As a bronze, aim to the head and left click 😃👍🏻
(I think Raze nade is very good, it has range and multiple hits, same to Gekko, Phoenix, and KAY/O)
You have nothing. Go farm and get mats/resources. Go to fortnitedb com and see what legendary schematics/heroes are available in your zone and run those missions. Try some weapons out and see what you like
u can. its because of mmr. mmr of iron might be higher than iron, mmr of gold player may be lower than gold.
How were you able to get better so quickly? I started back in June and I’ve been pretty much stuck in S2 this act. This is my first M&KB game, but been playing FPS games on console for a while
last meeting with the STW Team......  


we need changes .......  


marketing guys says: how about we change the login rewards so we can get rid of more players.....  


accepted
would actually be better than jett saying it
I'm hoping someone else will come along.
A Twine Peaks storyline obviously. And maybe even a new zone after Twine??
Anyone still down to do this? DM me
Ngl it would increase leaderboard toxicity, less people would enter for fear of having their failures shown on the leaderboard. I think a much more important generalizing stat that is KAST (Kill, Assist, Survived, Traded) Percentage, which actually shows value brought to the team without making players scared of engaging or playing for leaderboard as this stat rewards team play.
What platform did you play on? You should be able to go to the epic games website and sign in with your platform depending on what you played on
Not that I can remember, it had some good story with it
Most often I find them farming, they trigger the survivors while looking for chests, and then just ignore them.
I think I just use default… Because I’m comfortable with it
You have a free heal tho? I usually buy a flash+ghost on atk or sheriff on defence

theres a beta rn u can sign up for
If all you do is play games like Stardew Valley you're not going to enjoy Valorant. Fast paced twitchy FPS games like this take a lot of time to learn, and that's not even accounting for the massive amount of game sense in Valorant (agent abilities, predicting enemy behavior, situational awareness, etc).

A lot of people come from CSGO or even other shooters like apex/COD and are able to pick it up relatively quickly. If you don't have a background with any games like that, this is going to be a brutal experience for you. Just trying to keep it real.
bro spent 1500 just to spell reaver wrong
DE were originally not designed for sure hit/kill, most of them were/are like hirkamurs who’s just shift the fight in his favour. 🤓

Because it’s a hero shooter w roles so unlike cs where you can do enough yourself if u rly need to u need 1 player on smokes, one on entry at least, one for flashes, and most smokes u don’t wanna lurk, omen/viper only two who do, your entry lurking is annoying asl and you tend to have two duelists/entries. Info is good as well but technically not necessary ig u can play without them so far for me(d1 peak this act)

So best case looks like 2 entry(1 w flashes) 1 info 1 sent who’s lurking/holding flank and maybe viper or omen get to lurk. Other thing is you might not trust smokes to lurk bc if they die round might as well be lost if other team doesn’t troll.
The thing is they somehow made the maps even worse after reworking. That's just my opinion it might just be that I suck at the game lol
Even worse, some gekkos will just spam the wingman button and plant it wherever, lost so many rounds because of this
I mentioned in the [initial comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1bvazic/comment/kxy8b1a/) that I almost wanted to put everything in S-tier, but it wouldn't be much of a tier list if everything is in just one group, so I had to split them up somehow.

For the impact traps, I wanted 1 of them to be in S-tier. In reality, wall launcher is the one I use the most, but it is something that can be replaced, even if the alternative doesn't work as well. Like, with a floor launcher and a ramp, for example, or drop traps above to stagger husks back. But the sound wall's feature is irreplaceable.

Wall lights is one of such impact traps that, while useful in Endurance, can be replaced too. You can achieve the same result with a well-perked wall launcher or even sound wall, to stagger smashers off bridges.

I do use the tar pit in my Endurance. In fact, it's crucial to make my Plankerton UFO amp AFK-able, even during Wave 5, and all the way to W30. You can [see it in action here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1brdji2/the_tar_pit_is_unreliable_part_two_but_when_it/). But because I do proper blockoffs and trap tunnels, I never need them in normal missions, even in a [multi-ATLAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1brz843/pl106_traps_vs_pl140_husks_how_i_trap_my_cat3/) or [RtL missions](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1bf9nov/i_kinda_miss_cannys_terrain_another_lucky_spawn/).

>Gas traps since they were nerfed are absolute dogshit...

What are you on about? The gas trap in a 2x1 tunnel is still great [all the way to the 140s](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1bluul9/are_you_not_convinced_that_a_completely_walled/). I even use it in [PL211 defenses](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/1bggoct/how_do_i_unsuck_at_a_140_4x_rtl_van_mission/). Click on any of the links to see that I use the gas trap all the time.

>Flame grills are gigachad and deserve their own tier at the very top..

Who's the one baiting here?
Uh sorry Neon Main here
Any hardware melee that you can perk for CR, 2CD and AS will be good enough until you can get hold of a Surround Pound (or you get the Fury). Smasher Basher is often cited as an alternative, if it's flux.
I wish there was atleast a option to change them to pc version. Because now we can rebind every ability
This reminds me of Leon's handgun from Resident evil 4
Can u say what time specifically, 5:30 or something
Yup, and it's those same creators that do these \_\_\_ to immortal series and say "Smurfing isn't a problem"...Bruh, you're literally smurfing.
nah you do you man if you wanna play viper on any map you play don’t care what is meta or shit like that. If anyone has a problem with it ask them to pick other controller nothing wrong w 2 controllers anyways. You should be able to play whatever you want
But u would get banned right?
Shadow step isn't often enough to escape ISO ult and that ult also counters paranoia. Getting yoinked out of the fight every fourth round hurts.  

Then you add in all the Omen mains who are confident in their aim swapping out to Clove.

Harbor mains, myself included, are stubborn AF and the map pool is pretty good for us right now. Though we also acutely suffer from the broken ISO problem.  Realistically the ISO buff has nerfed every agent with abilities that give away their position.
tbh you shouldn't be worried about getting skins with the salaries you're on, at least val is f2p
LMAO I just started StW and this made me laugh 😂 it's always fun learning the things you can't really do in this game
Yeah i saw this bug on tiktok and people were abusing the hell out of it 💀 you can get on top of A site if you use jett, raze, and sages wall, so yayyyyyyyyyy
Honestly the mute button is best tbh. As soon as I hear someone being a dumbfuck in vc I mute them. Sometimes I’ll go back on them depending on this situation. Like if they are picking on a kid or just being super fuckin annoying something like that. But if it’s something directed toward me I’ll just mute em.
I mean as long as you had someone holding it you would be fine but I agree with mid changes but now halls is completely useless which makes the map less fun
yeah i learnt the common lineups for all 7 maps in rotation in like 2 hours the other day lol

used to having to do it on CS too

thanks man <3
Agreed, actually a fucking useless ability beyond comboing with raze and even that is outdone by other abilities
This is super cool but the link in your post to "ranks page" is just a static screenshot
monthly minimum wage? I highly doubt that
Deathmatches - Phonk, EDM, hard remixes, just anything with aggressive beats so I can feel that energy!

Unrateds - Catchy songs, ones with the real good rhythms and the OG songs (2000s and 2010s)

If I'm playing marshal only in Unrateds/Swiftplays, I listen to something I call 'Smooth songs', which are essentially 'Rhythmic Beats'. Beats that make you bop your head in rhythm haha

In comps, I've stopped listening to songs, I'd rather hear spike being planted in a far away site. But if I mess up my mental and start to lose focus, I listen to songs in the buy phase (via my phone's speaker), essentially ones that I love. Doesn't have to be catchy, aggressive, rhythmic, as long as it comes straight from my heart, I'm going to listen to it (:


I'll share my playlists sometime later when I'm on PC! Not English, so playlists probably a mix of different languages
I main KJ and Cypher. I love how consistent KJ is, my turrets and nanos go in the same spots every time. Cypher, on the other hand, lets me play more freely with where i want to put my tripwires and cages.
It would be very nice, once your done playing comp for the day, you didn't feel the urge to play another game. Instead, I'd like to have a much wider selection of casual and funny games modes. Like simple old capture the flag or a version of Michael Myers. Not to mention.. one simple, easy change that would be nice.. is adding seasonal maps for the casual playlist. Halloween maps, Christmas maps with a nice little Christmas tree on one of them.

Of course, I get why they also don't want to do this, and its definitely more difficult. But custom modded maps or something would be nice. Not to mention community servers. But I get this would be a very long distant feature to add. As it would be much more challenging to accomplish. 

Overall, we need more fun, and then they need to continue fixing up competitive.
Sound isn’t as important to me in MOBAs, so I listen to music while I play (which I don’t do in Val).  That helps a lot!
People complain about Duelists no entry, but you know what else we need? We need initiators who communicate when and how they are going to use their util so the Duelist can time their entry with it. And the team as a whole needs to follow up that entry immediately even if the Duelist dies. 
Anyone knows when it'll be fixed?
🤨
Hahahaha came here to say this. 

The people you’re queueing with are boosting you.
Aw is there a reason or they just can’t be bothered ☹️
you're probably using old weapons that havent been yet updated for the new movement anims
Skill issue
If you play well, your teammates will be worse. if u play bad, your teammates will be better
Zander too. Although I’m assuming the people that don’t buy flash are lower elo so I don’t blame them. I only started buying flash on omen pistol rounds when I got to plat (I started in iron)
Movement in general is WAY too fast. Players jump WAY too high. Its comical and unfun. Encourages non-tactful play.
Basically, controller agents block chokepoints connecting the site to other areas. The point is anyone walking through these smokes are immediately exposed to multiple angles. These smokes stop people from doing that. 

Wall smokes have the advantage when the chokepoints are larger than a dome smoke or there are more chokepoints than you have smokes. 

Breeze is a large, open map, so Omen can’t smoke all the chokepoints he should. No other maps are large and open enough to only use Viper for smokes.
I swear on my life it’s not. I’d even do it incrementally ie I gift £10 worth of skins then you give me £9, then I give £10 worth of skins then you give me £9 and repeat to eliminate the risk for whoever wants to do it with me. I’m no trying to scam legit just trying ti get real money for some money on my PS4 I have NO value in
it's a good wall, just curious tho what rank are you? Although tbh u get people in all ranks that doesn't understand smokes. I had people in litteral immortal lobbies freak out because i placed a site smoke instead of a smoke at the chokepoint when they were already out.
No that's not what I mean... It'll be a PR disaster because it *artificially created new problems* people don't understand this but What the server sees is *not* what the players see. And this isn't a "flaw" video games are designed like this because of our crazy little friend called ping difference. That's why lag compensation is applied on the client's end so that all the players can have a consistent and good time despite the ping differences. 

Just looks at the CS2 sub from a few weeks back, everyother post was like "networking suck!!! looks the bullets are not going were I point!!" And the video would just be recording of a freaking demo. You need to record you own screen, that's the closest representation of what happened. Not what the server sees or the demo looks like.
To not mess up my noob friends' games by playing unrated with my high mmr main account
Yeah. 3% does nott sound like much lol
I’d say only buy it if you happy with what u are gonna get. I’d probably buy it a day before it ends so u know what u are gonna get, I’m currently level 25 in BP..
That is insultingly low, i have almost 1800
If you’re really boosted then you would be bottom fragging nearly every game and would be demoting a lot. But if you’re maintaining your rank no matter what then you’re def fine.
Those are the worst, when you just watch the bullets trace their head. Then other times, I'll somehow get 2 headshots while running from 10m away.
Much younger player-base. Plus quarantine made people have less social skills. No social skills + developing brain don’t go well together. lol. And people feed off each other. So if one asshole tilts you, you’re already upset going into your next game. Like a domino effect. Just try not to let it get to you. These people don’t matter. Good luck in your matches. :))
If you're in Iron, you're bad. You simply don't know enough about the game to realize how bad you are. It's OK, almost everyone starts out pretty bad, but if you want to rank up you have to start at "I am the rank I am because I lack the skills to progress" and stop blaming things that are out of your control like AFKs/smurfs/team comp/ect. Like the other guy said, there will be AFKs on the enemy team just as often (actually slightly more often assuming you are never AFK), so just focus on the things you can control like your aim, crosshair placement, map knowledge and utility usage.
Some people have fps experience & are 3k hours hardstuck gold. 700hrs for top 2% is a great achievement :) I’d say the game becomes a bit tougher between Asc1-immo1 if you’re not confident in your mechanics, and then this gets even harder in Immo 1-3. Diamond 1-immo1 isn’t a huge difference in skill other than consistency IMO, there’s some really weak players who camp asc3/immo1 so it’s very possible if you go on a lucky winners queue streak whilst also performing well
Yeah I had a feeling. 

Reyna - check
no skins - check
decent aim - check
Oh well in that case i have no clue what those guys are up to lol. I havent ever seen a sage walling ascent mid but then again i haven't seen many sages on ascent as kj is just the go to sentinel there.

If the sage keeps doing that tho you have to tell them to stop it or atleast to actually play near the wall so they can punish lurks etc.
Reminder not to tilt queue as well or say anything if it's just negativity.


 
I've had a lot of problems being a toxic POS in general but especially in video games. Had a headache all day the other day and eventually started yelling at my team when we were doing really poorly. Rightfully got flamed 


Queued up again and 2 rounds in I made a couple rude comments before I muted everyone and just shut the hell up. Reminded myself repeatedly that, "It's just a game and everyone is doing what they can. Just don't talk if all you have are complaints." We got stomped 13-2 in the 2nd game but I eventually unmuted everyone and tried cracking jokes instead of being a douche. Everyone was pretty nice and we made the best out of a shit game 


 TL;DR Complaints do nothing; don't tilt queue
Looks like it was. Tried switching them out fully and numbers went back up.  
And now it says the one that was high before is super low.
No, she never was or will be unless she has massive changes or either raze/jett do.
No one reads the sub description :(
It's actually quite simple, you move slower while ADS, and the slower you move the easier you are to kill. While ADS does sometimes offer benefits like zoom and better first bullet accuracy, the reduction in movement speed is a tradeoff that is rarely worth it on Vandal and Phantom. This isn't like cod where you have to ADS to have good accuracy, you can easily hit headshots while "hipfiring" as long as agent has zero velocity and isn't spraying the gun into weapon inaccuracy.
This is the save the world subreddit, you want r/FortNiteBR but no, you won’t be able to get them after the new season starts, you’ll have to buy it now and do the challenges, btw the Fortnite Crew would be the best choice since you’ll get both this season’s battle pass and next season’s battle pass
i lub cypher y u bully him :(
Just did the SDs i never did and my daily challenges
> it still should have been 25…

Nah it should be like 15.  How often do you see your initiator player getting even 20 kills in a win?  If you get that many kills on a non-duelist agent your team is probably struggling.
Still don’t based off this pic lmao
Lol
that's fine lol. I wouldn't care and I'm a bronze 😭. I like playing with people who are high/drunk bc they don't get mad if I'm having a bad game.
Dawg be quiet 😂😂 sorry, not everyone has your anti-social personality disorder. Lol.
It’s true lol. Im imm2 rn and almost everyone buys a sheriff second round if they lose pistol
Using Omen to blind your opponent, teleport directly behind them while their audio is garbled and then stab them.
no
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yea, when that happens and they get really toxic about it it's an easy mute and report. You have no obligation to give them their gun back.
that's exactly what ruins interactive online gaming for people like me. I see those "just be toxic back" people every day and I'm not gonne be one of them
Isn't the tomato actually Uncle Pete's pizza pit mascot?
Getting double blinded by a one trick insta-lock Reyna player who hasn’t touched another agent in the entire game or grass since 12 B.C and if they don’t get Reyna they have some Schizophrenic freak out capable of destroying humanity
But it is cheating. It's not just about using a program to manipulate the system, it's about getting an unfair advantage, however that is achieved
I thought all these comments were all troll until I opened that YouTube link by OP…
> Even with every possible efficiency, the husks continues to be a problem.

Did you even read this line perhaps? 

Yeah I'd like to see you play with a video or two.
Bout 680 usd, I like it I’ll buy it. Rather do that then die without doing shit. (I’m in a solid financial position now that I’m older)
It can be hysterical a lot of times how far they'll go. Pretty much if they ever use a trading box, right off the bat UK they don't play the game. When I found legit players, if I needed something such as batteries, quartz, powercells, etc then I'd just ask. The biggest thing I'd say that ruined the game for a lot of legit players were the duping glitches and then the straightforward ssds, ie no questline required for ssd completion. The issue with that was that so many of those scammer kids just continuously duped crap like sunbeam and just got carried to high levels, causing annoyance to legit players. I will admit I've used the dupe glitch myself but only for trap mats really because after you get like 1k sunbeam, how quickly will you actually burn through that. Just that dupe glitch ruined a lot of the fun for legit players, the challenge. Without the challenge, it became boring and repetitive, and that's why so many legit players were done within a month after those major updates. But the biggest depression is that this game won't see life until it's sold to a different corporation because epic is slaughtering this game, getting rid of vbuck earnings, getting rid of daily log in, and just game changes that are ruining trap designs, not to mention the factors of a twine biome/storyline. The game has so much potential to be expanded, but epic takes the lazy route.
but diamond and gold are pretty close.
I play Raze at 1600dpi with 0.08 sens.
It’s a much better bow in my opinion and with stoneheart farrah it’s just so much more extra damage.
Ur confidence is fcked, play normals with friends or train less + play other games to take ur mind off it, training more wont help if you think ur going to lose every gun fight or bottom frag. Maybe pick another role to change things up. Gl
Agree main omen since unlocking and his flash smoke and ability to teleport are all very good
Oh I see you updated it with more than the first two.

I will say congrats on finding fns and Rawkus as they do indeed fit my criteria. 

I will admit defeat with the final statement that at that level igl/coach diff is a thing and I suspect both that guys are employing it but also fns is memeing for content lately.
They are made. The g502 is still the highest selling mouse.
As long as I get an hour’s gameplay out of $1 spent - I’m good. It’s cheaper than going to the movies!
Wdym, he did hit radiant, with teammates like he said. Didn’t know finding teammates in a team game is bad thing.
I use C, I find it the easiest to reach. I bind what would be the C ability key to Z.
I really enjoy zooming in on certain objects to see how much is normal map Vs texturing Vs topology, as a 3D modeller myself it's always so cool, and it's a part of 3D modelling I will miss when polycount no longer matters. A lot of the main environment are very simple bevelled boxes but the texturing really makes it look great - I sometimes play with lower graphics settings that basically take off normals and cards for foliage and nothing else so whilst there is less depth the models still have a lot of hand painted texture detail so things like brick walls still look good. 

The design team at riot is also just like, obviously so talented. The character art is great and I love the way they introduce asymmetry into the characters. Simple detailed design choices like nail polish to show the character -  Reyna's being sharp and metal tipped, cloves detailed ones that match her theme , raze with what simply looks like spray paint getting on them - even looking a bit chipped as she works with her hands. It's just neat. :)
oh boy, where do I even begin...
Hi! Female here who plays solo q all the time in Ca West and I almost never get flamers in comp too!
thats pretty average
How tf do you have so many mythic leads? I only have 3 or 4 at pl 50 lol
did i find a solution? having the same issue right now
Is there a set way to do the bug?
Sage ? ...Oh wait you said good ...
I cannot think of any game where dots are fun, no thanks
Mostly Omen. I think viable on all maps

And the viper vote I don't understand, cause I think viper is a bad solo controller, maybe only good in pearl as solo controller.
![gif](giphy|11mwI67GLeMvgA)
Everything other than compi isn't fun at all.
Wrong sub r/homenetworking
For me the cypher meta is the most stale thing in the game. If cypher is on one site it means he has those impossible to clear tripwires set up so go somewhere else and half my games are like this. It's boring.
Interesting take. 

Since I play one character and one character only, I'm not sure I agree with you. BUTTTTTTTT that is a way interesting take, for sure.
Sounds like you need to switch mains.  It's cool to like a character and the abilities when presented on paper, but oftentimes it just doesn't click and you'll have to put yourself into an awkward situation of learning a new character and their abilities.  The payoff is that once you find a character that meshes well with what you want to accomplish - they will complement your own abilities as well!  I wish you luck and I suggest Sage as a starter.
If not Boaster then Sliggy
Japanese sounds cooler because you don't understand it. Even if a character was saying " Today i farted in a cereal bowl" with that anime exaggeration it would sound cool. But to anyone who understands even an inkling of japanese it would be nonsense. Watch less anime lel.
Practice in range it's free FFS
They do but that's irrelevant to the conversation. "Skins that I like" means skins they want to use, not skins they want to trade. Also the post were on is referencing used skins not selling skins. Trading isn't the point here
Killjoys turret has been nerfed multiple times in multiple different ways, what the fuck are you talking about?
Not kind of, its absolutely insane. But it works for Riot so they'll just keep doing it, it's definitely the most greedy monetization i've ever seen, though. Upwards of $100 for the basic skins with no variations, animations, skins, or effects. That's not how the skins are advertised, it's almost a literal scam
yeah like he speaks russian and when you tell him to speak english if he can he starts yelling in russian
Honestly I’m usually ascendant and all of my diamond games have felt like that this act.  I think it’s time of day.  I mostly get on at night and it feels filled with trolls, people throwing, not comming, griefing.  I’m not super concerned with rank, I’m not making it to radiant so I just play for fun.  But it seriously diminishes the quality of games and makes it not fun to play.  I could play unrated and get better quality games
i mean SR Flor hit radiant at 14 years old, i would count that as gifted
if valorant has and will continue to be your main game and you've got 1k hours in it over your entire time playing it, paying 200 for a way to enhance your experience is fine lol
Yep I understand, it's so stupid, can't even go one match anymore without someone doing some shit that's going to just ruin something. And then usually half the time when I yell at people to like do work or something they just fucking scream at me but it's like bro you play the game for like 2 months and your power level 60 with mythic Storm King weapons and you're like already done with twine like shut the fuck up you barely know what the hell you're talking about.
Even with her buffs she's among the worst characters in the game. Her wall is okay but situational and you need to throw it from an angle enemies can't return fire from and you need to throw it preemptively.

Her Gravnet is terrible lest you pair it with another ability like a molly(Seriously, it makes enemies crouch in place, they know where you are cause it's the easiest thing in the world to figure out so they'll pre-aim you and since they're crouching they have increased accuracy).

Sound sensors can't hold flank cause enemies can just tip-toe through it no problem. Only use it ever has is through active choke points like Ascent A site or using it as a defender to guard spike.

Her ultimate is fun but so bad at the same time. Like, sometimes it bounces but sometimes not. I love using it though.
You’re getting the smokes at the doors at all? The smokes I’ve seen from fake clove duelists have been HORRIBLE ( that said they’re not in my games to see first hand )

You can't make up the stat of chamber dropping 80% in pickrate and act like he wasn't getting picked in ranked 90+% before. He got slightly overnerfed but pro teams were still picking him in some comps. 

He never died, if anything this version of Chamber is just.... balanced
Dude for like 2 whole minutes I honestly thought you were talking about a game controller.

I was so confused lmaoo
What did you use to record this OP? Obviously you would never really know that you're gonna get an ace, so do you just record all your gameplay or is there any other service which just picks up on this stuff using AI or something?
oh ma lawd thank you sm
Good mindset!
[removed]
Haven isn’t even in the game
Awesome job! Do you mind me asking what you used to animate it?
That's not how English works. Ever means ever and "in 15 years" is still "in years"
when an enemy appears in a location where you didn't expect, 

like imagine you're playing haven a site and you're shooting at a guy behind the box in the middle of a, you kill him but suddenly an enemy swings from heaven, you should in this moment overaim and strafe, he wont be able to hit you and if your aim is good you will get him.
I loke pearl because it's based on my home country, i miss haven and fracture too tho
Nah this was from back in the beta when I was ranked iron 2. This post was a joke.
Sage. Her ult is so high-impact. You're literally bringing another player back. Just revive the right teammate and you ca actually turn the game around. 

In terms of the most fun though, Brimstone for sure. Laser beam go brrrrrrrrrr\~

well, you can count me in the amount that don't understand it fully but not hate or anything. it's just like afaik trans person is someone who transitioned to  the other gender so why do you need to mention that you're trans if you're a woman/man now? stating your pronouns as she/her if you have a dong and a voice as deep as corpse husband is strange to me too
Ah, yeah the br subreddit is r/FortNiteBR 

Its a common mistake, dont worry
I love how high they jump, they are the only animal I actually will use as amount.
In US servers, they’ll throw because they don’t like your gamer tag.
Sorry to bear the sad news, but If you have 1 guy Gold in a sea of Silvers, it ain't Gold lobby. And frags don't matter. Period. 

But don't worry, you speak exactly how my bronze friends speak, so I know where you are coming from. Being humble and knowing there's always a bigger fish helps.

Cheers, have a good one
first step is to let go of your horrendous ego, if you're bronze after trying hard to get out of bronze then you're a bronze-level player

anyways look up woohoojin's rankup to gold guide on youtube, it teaches how to properly shoot which is all you need to get out of low elo

But can it run doom?
Sage was close to him and if I were the player, by game sense, I would expect that and risk the 5 bullets since I trust my aim lol
you have more time to react
Cumulative bans
100%. Like Breeze B. If you don't have a good trip counter (which is not uncommon in low elo) and a decent enemy cypher, the site is no longer playable.
That message saying a player you reported was punished, specifically if they were that high level of stereotypical toxic hate.


Delicious.

I don't care much about wining, I love having fun with people being smi serious about playing, the second I hear someone talking crap to anyone... That's my ick, Instantly lose all my will to help that player in any way.

Edit:I do not ay ranked for this reason.
Yeah Reyna nerf is needed. Her ultimate it way to easy to get and it's too strong. The invisible teleport is so strong I can see it being less time while invisible
Potatoes?
thank you so much its been so annoying
Yeah, but people would figure out what counts more towards gaining MMR thus changing the behavior in-game. Let's say for the sake of the argument that a spike plant counts as 5 kills, then very sweaty people would always take the spike to plant it even though it would be better to give it to a Gekko.

It would become a game of MMR manipulation instead of trying to win no matter what.

Hey man, you see how everyone is down voting you? That's usually a sign too stop commenting
it's like there's an OTP system for riot client ID they should do it for ranked queue but with Phone numbers. IMO that'd be the best option to reduce alt accounts botting and other problems. But multiple accounts increase riot's estimated market value cuz it increases average users so they won't do anything
Everyone knows the bp is going to be shit regardless so no poiny
Okay we can assume they start in plat/diamond, still smurfing right? 

I 100% agree that if someone is playing badly or buying account to play with lower ranks that’s pretty malicious, but in OPs example of Curry that’s not the case.
I feel like you should touch grass. It’s common for online games to go down for updates, and Riot is even nice enough to warn us in advance. To wait a couple hours for the new patch to be rolled out is worth it.
don't ask people to do hard missions for you
I swear to god this must be a NA thing
im just saying what i am now bcz he wants to bring up old posts LMAO
Well, sometimes, it's better to have an experience rather than google it. We are several real human beings testifying that we did offer the battle pass with vbucks at some point. So... Here you go.
you can still make a destroy the encampments mission, but defend the atlas is more what save the world was about, you build a fort around an anti-storm atlas and you kill zombies to protect it. also i know its weird to get a comment on a 5 year old post, but i was browsing google and saw this thread
I’ve read that it’s somewhere around 10 frames quicker IF you do it perfectly so ye not worth spending time on.

It’s just something that came over from cs since quite a few cs players (tier 2 - 3 pro’s) swapped to Valorant when it came out and they all counter strafe by default.

In cs you slide a bit when you let go of your movement key and it takes a while before you are fully accurate so you win a lot of time by counter strafing, in Valorant you stop almost instantly and don’t need to counterstrafe.
Nah, Frankfurt is fine. Paris is the worst in the world
It's just muscle memory from older versions of Csgo, you shouldn't be be using it, since its not what your used it, it will cause you to over swing the shots. just keep as is, or whatever suits you, no need to copy any players.
Anyone got any?
those midnight games are different
Silver I think. I've plateaued more recently at Plat after peaking Diamond, but Silver has the biggest problem with Crab Mentality by far. You can blast your way through most of the enemy team at the front of the pack, but randoms will still manage to throw rounds like they're actual NPCs. Any attempt to IGL will be met with anything from apathy to genuine vitriol, it's like herding cats down there.
Lol…. Very much the opposite.

I’m just against purchasing in-game content in general. Predatory Marketing has been a toxicity in gaming and has eaten the purity of what used to be.
Why are they so far away from each other? Are you able to back up a lot?
I mean just look at them look at chamber where is that hot personallity he has its like he turned feminine
It's not even smurfs when Riot on rank resets sends more and more people there.  
Just this reset I've been playing against ex plat and diamonds in silvers, so I lost and now I'm bronze. This is worse than even CS ranks.
Hell yea bro I like that one too
I suck I can't even get out of iron lol
My teammates never bought, even at 9-12 so I got really frustrated and just went in like that..no idea how I survived the plant or even got a kill..and no they did not win the round :(
Was literally my first skin cause I thought it was so cool, and now I can't even equip it for some reason. It's not like I play worse it just gives me bad feelings

He wasn't talking about you, OP said he doesn't like killjoy and if he likes setups then it's weird that he doesn't like killjoy
Bro wtf this question xD

Riot literally make 3 new map for this.
How the fk it can be permanently?
Yes .The most toxic and mad  players are french players .on 0-5 score on ranked game he can left eazy .The most dead inside gamers on french servers .The worst server ever
No it means harder to learn.
Almost don't play this game, but when I do and I get 2 Germans that just talk german to each other unless they want to blame the team is not very uncommon and pretty annoying
Really? You don't see the problem with that?

If they don't want to play smokes, then they can hover over what they DO want to play. When someone hovers over smokes, it indicates that they will play smokes, giving the rest of the team the choice of playing other roles. If they hover over smokes and then lock something else, they've just trolled the team to play the game without smokes.
He can dox u anytime
He wants his NedKit! 🤣
It is def too high, should cut it down by at least half. BUT, only if you have a big enough mouse pad to support it. Make sure you have enough pad space to do a full 360 when sweeping across from one side to the other.
Really unfortunate but isnt he decayed here? How does he not die still
except you need to spend like 2 missions for a daily, so thats like 40 minutes instead of 1. Sooo 40x the work for the same reward. They should at least increase the reward to make up for the extra effort.
ez solution. play duelist
Ive come back from games that were stomps just getting the plant early and using proper util as viper. Ended up with less than 5 kills the whole game, but planted the bomb every round and just placed smokes and mollies
corporate meetings*
Check the modifiers?!
Nah, if someone’s throwing I just try harder to make it take longer for them. We’ve even brought it back a couple of times and they start trying again. I don’t see people being overly toxic much but when that happens I usually just talk to them like they’re being a baby to embarrass them more
These are all super solid points, and I appreciate you for taking the time in writing it all out! I posted this video in another channel and got similar feedback, so I know it's something to improve going forward. I think the idea of explaining what happens in a round before it happens is great, and I have seen others doing it so I know it's something people expect when coming to videos like this. 

Also fully agree on the audio. I'm working on ways now to reduce that issue cause I noticed it as well. What I was hoping to get out of the first few videos I put out was mostly just getting familiar with the process of recording, editing, and uploading. I think now that I'm there I can fine tune like you're saying and get more comfortable with the experience of the video itself. 

Thank you again I'm 100% gonna try and incorporate some of these in my next video! I think explaining a video, fixing the audio, and keeping the video more visually engaging are the three things I'm gonna focus on for the next one.
*Uses ulti*

Damn nice 😭 just gave me an idea thank you
I am gonna do this
This happened to someone else in a deathmatch I was in yesterday. Hopefully it gets patched soon.
If you are only doing it for the skins you were probably wiped so they deleted all of your progress

i have 4k monitor and it was more expensive than 240hz one back when i bought it lmao
It’s just a karma farm post
I mean most agents if you can’t hit your shots you’re mostly useless. Yeah other agents have useful utility but if you’re dying before using it, or not able to consistently trade your teammates you’re also useless. I’ve played with just as many useless Sovas, Omens, Killjoys, etc as Reynas. A useless Reyna is probably better to have than an agent with important utility that is useless imo.
If you're 5 stacking than how is the enemy going to harrass you via all chat just mute them tf. You expecting comms from them or something??
The mute button is a beautiful thing
Corsair iCUE was another reason my friend used to get banned (happened several times with multiple accounts. There are other similar posts about it)

> People don't complain when a smurf carries them, though.

And it ends up hurting you later in the season, I cannot explain how fucking frustrating late season diamond is when you get the most blatantly boosted people playing in your lobby, and it's not even aim it's basic game sense that they lack.

This is why CSGO ranking although a bit saturated is much better fitting because a bottom frag that gets continuously carried will take 3-4x longer to rank up versus someone who tops frags every win and has a 60% win rate.
For sure but I doubt I would be able to pass my peak of ASC 2 that easily
i have zero damn clue why people always so aggressively recommend clip on these posts. yeah, she is a big boost to farming... but farming is something you spend like <5% of your playtime doing, you can go as slow as you want, and doesn't matter in the damn slightest. genuinely why does it matter if you get like 30% faster mats per second in a private lobby?

dennis jr. is an easy pick. TRO is perhaps the best *thing* in the entire game (aside from BASE builds of course). key to just about every single offensive damage build in the game, unless you wanna get weird with it. but you will need a second battle beat hero to activate the perk. i'd recommend researching battle beat wildcat using epic flux from the research book.
(Aside from you posting in the wrong subreddit) What’s the issue here? 


- You need 70 Stars to claim this page. 

- You have 10.

- You’re 12 levels away from 200, with 5x Stars earned each level. That’s 60. 


- 60 plus the 10 you have = 70
removing a core game mechanic because a small amount of unlucky shots is terrible. People tend to remember dying to them *because* it's a rare, and admittedly tilting experience. However, nobody remembers the times they died while the other person stood still and shot them, so it seems like run n gun makes up a lot of their deaths. Another thing that makes people think it's more common than it is is ping difference. Someone who counter strafes and one taps will look like they're running n gunning on someone else's screen due to ping.

In reality, run n gun kills are pretty rare, and in any case, it's a viable strategy. Someone running and shooting is going to take longer to kill you most times, so if you still can't kill them and they end up killing you, that's no fault but your own. It's also mainly a close range tactic. If you get isolated at that close a range, again, it's your fault. Obviously the Neon in this vid really isn't at fault, she just got unlucky. But then what's the difference between this and getting spammed through a smoke? Should we remove shooting through smokes because getting killed in such a way is also tilting?
Needing a ps4 code! Been wanting to play in console since it first came out, please!!
Congratulations? Doesn't making body spraying any less of a bad habit.
Ascent and Haven are solid maps and will not be rotated. Rotations aren't based on seniority, they're based on which maps need to get looked at and reworked.
Thank you for the advice! \^\^

Personally I've just been playing a lot of ranked lately as I want to try to hit ascendant before school starts again as I will not be able to play much after :(. I get where you are coming from though!

&#x200B;

I also feel like I do not tilt queue as my performance (on tracker at least) has been somewhat consistently good even after 10 games? I just can't seem to carry; either by out-aiming my opponents during fights as Reyna or by being a team player.

&#x200B;

I have also been accused of smurfing but this is the only account I am using, maybe I am washed and clapped hahahaha
to compete
one time i got a 100hr penalty 2 matches after the one i AFK’d for (was also TDM) with no warning message. it was reversed the next day on its own. what sucks is if you do contact support you just get auto-responses saying they don’t review penalties when you’re detected afk, etc. so even if it IS a weird bug or mistake, you’re just stuck in a support loop that never goes to a real person and you just have to wait it out.
As much as I’d love a Genshin collaboration, there’s no way any of it would come to STW 💀
You're not smurfing. Sometimes people use the terms "alt account" and "smurf account" interchangeably, but in your case, it's wrong to do so.
Guy gives me a compliment. Think's I can solo it. Leaves. I couldn't solo it.

Where am I at fault?
I pretty much only play deadlock in spike rush and capture those who are trying to take orbs 🤣🤣
I count it as ace when the announcer says ace. And if you messed up the objective you don't deserve an ace anyways. IMO.
Minima is the best skinline
i like how this post is to show how comedic the game is and people are flaming him 😂
Even if you had it as your main gamemode, the second you switch to another one and play a match, it's back to acrolling a dozen times
Why are you toxic? You ok bro?
Trans people can be non binary, but not all non binary people are trans btw. Actually almost transphobic to label them all as one.
I hate people that ban people for the tiniest things. It shows insane insecurity. 

All the more reason this “revelation” makes even more sense. 

When you’re a fraud, you do not like people questioning you. Creates cognitive dissonance, etc.
Just instalock lol everyone is dogshit at their agents in your elo anyway.
None it's easier to get 5 stack and climb together, I tried to change my playstyle with other agents didn't change the fact that I drop 25 kill keep winning clutchs but unfortunately they can't hold bomb site B lol

I make the call-outs in TR side and I'm always winning because I'm with the team and it's easier to win a round but in CT damnnnn I need somehow try to hold A site and same time be smart enough to rotate early to make sure they hold the other side. It's harsh to climb Solo Q
Honestly I'd buy the 2023 vandal any day now, it sounds way crispier than anything else. I own the RGX phantom, it might not be the prettiest skin but I love the sound and 'cleanliness' of the skin itself. Guess I'm skipping this one.
Dude right lol. “I’m low hp I’m hanging back” like fuck no dude that’s exactly why you should be first man in.
Yeah I believe that's why I received 10k vbucks
Ill never understand why people care so much about skins that theyre willing to drop 60 bucks on em. Sure they look nice but they're also not real and it doesn't affect the gameplay in any way
This is not normal. It is a bug. Has been in the game for over a year now.

u/freighttrainusa any updates on when melee heavy attacks are gonna get fixed?
Like there are skins that are too distracting imo and i wouldnt use them just like i wouldnt use one of the aks with hieroglyphs and shit on em

And some animated skins sound and feel really nice without being distracting. U get to choose. Anyway I dont disagree that val looks like a childrens game, it kinda is but whatever 
Thank you for keeping my heads up
Like fish in a barrel
So does Brutus (and several other BR characters)... in fact its the exact same 3D model.
Not anyone in particular but I don't like streamers that seem to be just goofing off a lot in ranked, maybe even throwing and then "lololol I wonder why we lost that yall suck *scream into mic*" (exaggeration but yknow).
Like what if that was a teammate's rank up game. It's fine if everyone's having a fun time but sometimes the team isn't having fun and the streamer ends up really annoying :/

 Silver is really high for a very new player such as yourself. 


 Most ppl were hard stuck iron for years, and youre already almost gold..... 


 Still it depends on your experience with a keyboard and mouse, I got my first laptop to play val on 2 weeks ago.( I only had a phone before that, and I'm very bad at using a keyboard even though I use it regularly for school, I am really bad at Val.)

Maybe other options to consider: PS5 (no PS+ required for Fortnite) or Geforce Now subscription.
solo orb controller is fine on Sunset, no?  
I played her on it last night, and while she has the same type of problem as Brimstone (can't smoke globally, even from mid, you have to cross top mid in order to smoke A or B choke, + her one ways are ass), which is why I think she will never be better than Omen (my opinion), she was still more than enough for Sunset.

now when I see people locking her as solo controller on Breeze or Icebox, we do have a debate. but here, I don't think the Clove is the problem in your comp
I have about two minutes of aim labs and haven’t gone into the range since I was silver. It all came from spamming deathmatches ( I have like 70 hours of dms) and focusing on gun hygiene and clicking heads.
well, my last game obv. you can fool stats easily tho. he has hardly bothered with that either.
He's having a hard time finding a place in the meta, but he's far from a throw pick. His ult is undeniably strong for fast site takes, especially on maps with 3 sites where he can easily create 4v1 situations for his team. His wall and vulnerable are very situational and pretty hard to play around, but they can be valuable on occasion.

However, perhaps most critically, he lacks the ability to take space like Jett or Raze unless he can get a kill first (which is not a good thing to bet on). Without a flash, he has a difficult time clearing 50/50s and on his own and without a movement ability it's difficult for him to get in positions that let him take advantageous fights with his team.

He functions great as a follow-up entry duelist which can clean up after a duelist with the ability to take space enters the site. His double tap makes him a very annoying target to take down without dying, especially when he is surrounded by allies. As a solo duelist, there are better options.
HEAL ISN‘T NEEDED
THIS ISN‘T OVERWATCH
Oh, don't you worry, just a matter of time.

Although I also had a decent new player experience most of my unrated games were other new/newish people vibing and chatting.
Fracture is a masterpiece compared to Breeze
I'm in late 20s, i just insta mute everyone and run a match through text chat like league. Love comms but mostly just abused by kids either just being weird or screaming for no reason.

Mainly this is necessary since console will have some amount of aim assist/snapping
To be fair Deadlock and Killjoy's kits is themed around high-tech gadgets and Raze's satchels break the laws of physics, so they're not exactly ordinary
Yeah. I think they will be strong in the right hands, but we'll see!
Thank you for watching my video and replying! I will be checking out AgentAcademy immediately :)) Okay so no wasting Dizzy, better planting spots- the conversion rates are super interesting btw i didnt know there was a statistic for that, i will be going off of those from now on! And being prepared to fight as i peek and doing it more advantageously. 

Yeah thats true, i didnt want to expect people to watch a full game in case they didnt have time but i will be seeking that out aswell! I think it will be very insightful. Thank you again!
Idk the Neon changes aren't the best, I'd prefer it if she kept 2 stuns and they temporarily disabled util so she can deal with Cypher trips and maybe revert a bit of the cocaine demon changes like 2 slides or perfect sliding 1 tap. Her design already dosen't mesh with the game its just unfun to play against someone who calls you bad for not hitting shots on something moving so fast that's its out of your control.
It was definitely not pointless. I promise you that.
Also I've only been playing 2 weeks
Thanks for the advise, appreciate it \^\^.
how do you even surrender i have been trying to figure it out for the past hour
Any agent that makes you plan what you want to do. I stopped really playing duelists since I always wouldn't think before an action. I've been personally playing Omen for probably a year now, and I feel happy being able to execute plans created in my head for the team. Still, don't play to far back that you are self reliant (if that makes sense), like only getting kills off your util for yourself and not talking to your team, similar to what u/YEENYWANTSBREAKFAST said. You want to be there with your team, when they die and when you die also. Thanks for reading, I hope I am of help to anyone! Stay safe.
It has been 2 months since i started playing valorant. And it is controllable for me i enjoy playing in High sense also I don't have enough desk space.
Server lag even with great ping, platform PS4. Happens when jumping/running or shooting.
styrofoam 3 rank
It's not important to have a high hs% rate, but you'd probably benefit from better/higher crosshair placement and aiming at the head instead of body spamming which you probably do, especially with Ghost, Sheriff and Vandal.
Ok sounds good

What is your playstyle, more aggresive, more passive, supportive, infobased…
The fact that you NEED gekko and sage on a map already indicates that it's broken. And it's still akward even with those 2

Well yes if we remove bot accounts we get less smurfs. 

But from what I seen in my LoL days. Riot doesn't ban account there were once in a time "bots". 

Checking others match history is so much easier on LoL, and there whenever you saw a smurfing loser. You could go into his match history and see he played like 5 ranked games, and before that he had 15 player vs AI intermediate where he always goes 2/14. 

It's so damn obvious, yet I never ever got feedback from getting them banned from botting

1) Buy the legendary flux in the store each week.


2) Don't recycle heroes/schematics because you need the evolution materials right now. With the thought that you can just research the item from the collection book later. You waste soooo many training manuals and flux etc that way. Rather spend a day farming evo matts and proceed from there.
 

3) Do a little research into the heroes/schematics that you're going to use most frequently so that you can focus your initial upgrades.


4) Never recycle a trap durability survivor. Building up a full squad, of trap dura survivors is your long term goal for running endurances succesfully, which offers sooo much free xp/mats.


5) Most importantly pay attention to the story line. It is so much fun, so take the time to enjoy it :)
I even cease to watch these Youtuber's Neon gameplay. They just go full nuts. WASD pressed like 100 times in like 5 seconds and your mouse probably rotated like an spinning ball
lol, it’s a semi auto shotgun…..
You dont rank up by playing. You rank up by playing against and winning engagements against people with a similar MMR as you, getting put in higher ranked lobbies (you are here), and then winning matches. You're getting paired against people who are higher rank than you because the game is testing to see if you deserve a higher rank, and from your performance I would say the answer is definitely no. So you lose a string of games and your MMR comes back down to your skill level and you'll get put back against other iron/bronze players. This up and down cycle repeats until your skill level improves to the point that you start beating the high bronze/silver players, you stick the bronze rank, and start being tested against silver/gold lobbies on the upswing of your MMR cycle.
Nope it’s your
Run and gun is the most fun
I don't believe you.

I keep seeing people say that aim comes with time but how much time? I’ve been playing since neon was released but I still cannot aim at all and I’m stuck in silver. Feels like I’ve plateaued and time in range and death match doesn’t seem to help at all. Any advice?

Oh no, I guess the skybridge will turn into one big bashing altar. They could have coded them to just walk up the stairs, not attack them. Would that not have fixed the ‘block off’ usage? I think this will be affecting a lot of people’s ssds/endurance. I’m trying to find a way to ‘disguise’ the stairs. I tried replacing them with ramps but the mini bosses hated the ramps 😩
Your level has no correlation to your rank whatsoever, i dont know when people developed this mentally deficient concept.
Yes
It's just one rank you're not so much higher ranked. You're barely higher ranked.
Oh no I understand they aren't why I can't rank up, they just make the process more miserable lol.

I wouldn’t be scared just because of levels. Someone who grinded the last 2-3 months to level 50 can easily be better than someone who played on and off since release and hit level 200. 
They might have an advantage but most importantly I wouldn’t let that get into my head.

I did not check because i was afraid of how much it would be, but i had no idea it would be so high. I quit the game for a long time after that.

I hope with the nerf to satchels they buff the accuracy of AOE of showstopper cuz the way it does negligible  damage when it hits the enemy just 10 pixels away
Look at the space inbetween your crosshair and the target, so that you can see both in your peripheral vision and what you're actually focusing on is watching the gap close between the two and timing the shot for when they overlap
I'm just thinking losing those 5 placement games through 5 stack would drop me to a lower rank. Ngl after the rank reset ranks are going to be fucked anyways
No it isn’t a fact. Reported.
He means the sub not the game
The easiest to play for new people are Sage, Killjoy, Kayo & Raze honestly.
Definitely a high skill ceiling for some of these, but their abilities are straightforward and they take the least brainpower to play which leaves you open to train that aim!
Balance logic behind it,
if they don’t notice the top search being “fortnitebr” they aren’t gonna notice “fortnitesavetheworld” because they clearly aren’t reading
See, these videos always blow my mine cuz I was ranked iron before and it wasn’t even close to this bad…

Great play OP, it’s always good to laugh at ourselves haha. We all have plenty of clips like this
Bro, I actually thought I wrote this post. LMAO
i have tried it with voice chat off, text chat off, enemy team muted. makes it enjoyable and interesting for practicing angles

My friend and I kinda make a joke about it at this point. We are like let’s see if they are women haterz or not 😂 #womenhaterz
Bad
So, yes, it can force them to stop shooting chromies. Got it.
I mean, no mate everyone makes mistakes, you think people don't mess up at immortal as well? I can tell you they do, all the time, me included.

If you aren't ranking up, it's because you aren't at that level yet, and that's fine. But you can't put blame on everyone else because they made a misplay.
ITS SO LARGE AHHH. I physically can’t rotate from A to C in time unless I play neon

When I was hardstuck Diamond, I was constantly climbing and even went on a 13 game win streak to hit Ascendant.. Since hitting Asc 1 I’ve been hard stuck Asc 1 and can’t climb up or down. The lobbies are absolutely more difficult. I have 10 Asc wins so far all in Asc 1. Before that I was constantly climbing. I have Immortals and Asc 3s in my lobby with rarely any Diamonds. I was getting 15-25 kills in the Diamond lobbies and now I’m getting 10-15 kills at best in the higher Ascendant lobbies. Everyone’s hidden mmr is different mate.
didnt even see the post tho
Ik that it is hard to carry, not even trying since even in the 140s I usually have a hard time lol

gonna try the xenon one then, it is a nice weapon, but any speccific perks? Thinking of cc cd fr and dmg maybe
It's bugged right now
even if there’s solo q, you will still encounter the same amount of smurfs. lvl20+ rank ready accounts are 3eur lol.
when you deathmatch do the 1.5 second rule that I think n0thing does? When you see an enemy strafe and just dont shoot for 1.5 seconds only track and i think for you that’d be the best way for you to improve on low sens
this is fine if you lose first round, but you're putting your team at a huge disadvantage to win second round if you do this when you won first round.  much better to buy a stinger, spectre, bulldog, etc with your economic advantage.  but you have to buy with your team, so you have to convince others to do the same because you're risking throwing the round if you're the only one who buys, hence my frustration
Just say "skill based matchmaking" and move on it's just the bad game not the bad life
Seemed clear as hell . Giving you the benefit of the doubt , i still  am not convinced why you didn't just subtitled it hindi rather than translating the whole thing into english
Uninstall this shit game
thats so cool

Tbh story line stops being useful around mid canney from what I remember. Not much point doing it
They should have some mechanism where you remake because of AFK (but never leave), then everyone unanimously identifies the person. The remaking team loses nothing, the other team gets like +5rr and the guy who caused the problem gets a multi-day ban.
Tbh its a  funny thing if you soak that many hours you should be at least mediocre in game
bottom elo experience, match outcome is largely NOT dependent on you

stop playing to win/for your team/teammates. play to improve, ONLY

I wouldn't even queue comp as iron tbh, spam TDM

you should be focusing purely on getting good at gunfights until you're like g3/p1

duh? Skill to any gun, if its run n gun only, jugde only, sheriff only. 

shotgun only is HARD on game knowledge as you have to be an expert at reading enemies while also being able to one shot them

I haven’t done aim training in about 6 months and i’m diamond 3. At this point the most common reason i die is because of whiffs/bad aim.
As a new Valorant player and former Ow player I agree completely. Playing Val made me realize how generous Ow is. I have every single ashe skin including all legendaries and I haven't paid for any of them.

This is why i've almost entirely swapped to brimstone drop my util and play entry because god knows the two instalock duelists would rather lose the game than have to play scary entry.

I love seeing neon on my team because at least they commit to stuff. Reyna Jett are instalocks that won't touch site unless they have full info 2 flashes and someone already pushed and died.  Yoru's are basically gone half the match lurking somewhere then flame you.
Yeah in low elo it’s a bit harder to get value out of info heavy agents such as cypher (however the trips are quite good) I’d say just keep on locking Jett/Reyna until you’re gold and then you can pick cypher back up if you like his play style :)
Thats true yeah and i still do think viper will be useful on icebox but due to her nerf we might see some more different controllers on there imo but we will have to see in upcoming days
haven 🥺
Good choice!  

I've been running my hotbar lately with a Xenon bow in the #1 slot, Vacuum Tube bow in #2, and Surround Pound in #3 during mission build time, then switching to a PotShot during the assault time.
Yes o see how childish you are, you're a cheat and a disgustingly behaved child that.in my classroom would either have to sit and shut up of have wasted your parents money! No go to sleep kid.

Your parents would be ashamed of you right now if they saw this. You're a typical Z gen brat with no future. No peice of paper will get you a job of ANY kind with that kind of attitude.

and hes literally playing battle royale whats your point here idoit
Bait used to be believable.
its to hardwire map into your muscle memory
Somehow I always win 1 and lose 1, I hope I can rank up but the past 6 games have been like that
Its honestly insane, I’ve met people that I’m friends with but not q’d with in the same comp team on the opposing side 😭
I was thinking I wish they made it where if you run a loadout with an outlander commander then all mission rewards for you were cut by 50%. Literally almost every mission I load I have to run constructor and the other 3 are always outlanders. Epic should make that change with a notation of "outlanders are great for private lobby harvesting but there is a very toxic epidemic of far too many players running outlanders and it damages the game experience so run Ninja, Soldier, or Ninja for full rewards or Outlander for half". I get they aren't "totally worthless" but by far they are the most selfish option when 4 people are working on a defense mission.
I guess I should have added the /s at the end
Disagree. Some people dont have a good setup, some people dont have any fps or gaming experience at all. Some people play very little. Yk, golds arent THAT bad haha
cheers love the cavalries here
Haha unless you're a long lost one I don't think so! If you're east/central NA I'm down to queue sometime with a fellow elder millennial.
Bro I'm in bronze and I can't tell if this is iron or plastic 😭😭😭
Besides making all the perks legendary nothing!

2x crit dmg and one crit rate is perfect. Then use the extra slot for fire rate or reload speed 

Snare is good but you could also use affliction if you want (really up to you)
Sure, there are a few freaks of nature who can perform well at every moment, but that's definitely not the standard. Even the most consistent player in the world (2021-22 Yay) is having a rough time now that circumstances have changed. Valorant simply has so many variables that it's impossible to always perform, unless you're a smurf who completely outclasses the competition.
Point 1 is not entirely correct. Imagine if the Reyna player on the same B long position but pushed up much forward. If the Reyna gets a kill and dismisses immediately, the dismiss duration will not be long enough to retreat her back to any cover. The enemy team will trade her instantly when she is out of dismiss. Or even if she does gets to cover, jett can pop dash immediately to follow her and gets the trade. 

So, lesson taught in point 1 for reyna is? “I should not be pushing up so far out that my dismiss cant reach a cover.” 

Side note, just wanna say my favourite agent Yoru, can push that far out and TP back with very little consequences, when played right.

I love spike rush, its like Valorant Arcade mode. In any mode I really could not give a shit when people want to play with made up rules or knife fights. Im either there to warm up, play quickly, or practice. If people want to play with knives only or some other shit - go make a custom game.
The truth is you probably played with a lot of under 15yo and you never knew it.  
Every free to play game or very cheap game has A TON of children in it and you have to live with it. Some of them can carry your match, some cant, it happens.  
Its a free to play game, he was your rank+- and theres no "match by age" thing going on.  
Smurfs are common and riot doesnt care enough yet to make a change, but again, sometimes they are are carrying you sometimes they are carrying others

If someone calls “can I ace, or I have 4 kills” I’m fine leaving it. If they don’t, I’m taking that any day of the weeks. I expect the same of myself
Before started playing I only know one name: Killjoy, so I unlocked her first, and turned out she suits me quite well, so I play her ever since
It works!!!!!

Had to quit valorant cuz of this 🥲 i never disclose my gender but still get hated on bcs they always figure out im a girl since my skins are all girly and pink and they always hate even if im not bottom fragging or doing bad 😭 i just usually mute and report these people but it’s so annoying to do this at literally every game so i just left ahaha


Also, men get hated on a lot too but as a woman, you will literally get sexualized even when you’re not talking which makes it a lot harder to deal with
Personally, I don't defend Epics. It's just that Daily rewards have long seemed to me a vestige that needed to be changed. Since they changed this after many years, it seems that other changes can be expected in the future, such as the characteristics of survivors.
inb4 Reyna main who drops 30 because they bait their entire team and "why don't I win" when they always end up in a 1v3
Sorry that happened or congratulations idk I didn’t read past the first sentence
I mean that kind of makes sense if people are underperforming. I think whoever has the most kills is probably the best player and when you’re stuck with bad players it sucks. So I can understand frustration. If someone sucks, they suck get back to the aim range or play unrated
ISO, I can’t believe he can tank a shot from the operator and not receive any damage whatsoever

It’s really not that complicated. If she’s clearly good enough for the main team, sign her like any other player. If not, put her on a development team in a lower tier and involve her in scrims, just like a male player who’s not quite at the top.

honestly i've lost count of how many systems with windows 10 or 11 that i've built or repaired that the only time EAC actually causes an issue which is maybe 1 in 1000 perhaps, is often just needing to delete the EAC files, and let it redownload for fortnite.
I can't choose when my duo's internet goes down either. Maybe in that suggestion, you could say I'm not being punished for that since I wouldn't lose more rr than the current system but that's a weak argument
Apex has more cheaters plus more gimmicks. I'm not saying it's a skilless shooter but I wish say if you don't subscribe to tap strafing and particular character based tech you just won't rank up in that game. Val is a generalist shooter skillset type of game which doesn't have any meta defining gimmicks other than deadzoning but that's the only fundamental that's non universal from game to game whereas apex has waaay too many
I think it’s more blatantly obvious that you will lose just by the first 5 rounds. It seems has though no matter how good you are the style of the game doesn’t match solo q. It’s much more team based than ever and because there isn’t strict punishment of throwers they keep unbalancing games.
This is an actual question I wanted to ask. I already know that placing these traps together do cause some lag. It's nice to know there isn't one main cause as to why or how the lag is caused by them.
I found your issue… Your highest win rate is on Fracture.
Look. At. Your. Fucking. Minimap.

If you are not actively waiting for someone to swing on you or actively pushing around the map, the amount of information the minimap can give you is endless.

You'll see people who peak your teammates or their util, you'll see reyna eyes and sova darts and fade eyes.

Look at your fucking minimap, its so outrageously important.
every agent is really good in this game. makes it a matter of who you want to play
This... i started with over 300 fps average and over the years dropped down to under 200. Did a fresh windows install and i am back to over 300 on average
Granted the sample sizes are small but I feel like proportionally I encounter just as many toxic women as men. You just think there's more toxic men because you see them almost every game whereas a lot of your games either don't have women in them or they're not talking because of general stigmas. I do also find though that the toxic people tend to run in groups. If there's a guy being toxic and a woman is in a party with them she's probably also toxic AF.
I had to duo queue with my buddy out of plat 3 to hit diamond for the first time just because I kept getting throwers or just having unlucky games. I don't think you're boosted. Keep grinding homie
A bit more than an arm's length away
Yeah exactly, if team A has a solid smoker + cypher and team B just locks in whatever then its essentially a 90:10

Never played Reyna in my life lol. Cypher/viper main
My theory is that Epic didn't (and still doesn't) have a plan for Fortnite at all. When it was first revealed, it looked like a PvE survival sandbox game like Project Zomboid or Rust, then it became kind of like the StW we have today, but then they added a BR over the course of a few months to capitalise on the fad and, oh no, people liked it. Now they're trying to convert the game into Roblox due to how successful Creative has been at retaining players, with everything (even BR) taking lower priority. T6 materials were clearly planned since they exist in game, but I doubt they'd even started designing unique biomes for a new zone since Twine was still using Stonewood and Canny biomes at the time.

>Do you think they'll ever reinvest in Save the World, and if so, what do you think that would even look like, so many years later?

I don't think they'd ever fully reinvest in Save the World (like they were in 2017-2019) because Creative simply gets more players playing for longer, but I don't even know what they could add that would feel substantial. The new heroes, weapons and zones are nice but the game still has a lot of fundamental balance issues and strange mechanics that I don't think could be fixed in a patch unless Epic were willing to piss off half the current player base and rework most of the game.

I rlly want a code 😭
Jett ain't need no nerf
Personally, I don't care if the duelist gets kills on entry. Though I'm in low elo so my auto lock duelist doesn't know what entry is and that it's what they are supposed to do. And then when I try to explain they get mad and don't listen therefore ending with me on entry as a sentinel.
Enjoy!
He probably pulled your IP, that only gives a rough location (like the town). I have no idea how he could’ve done it through Valorant, so maybe you added him on something else too? Or opened a link he sent?
why do people keep posting shit like this
What SSD are you doing?
Holy shit your tracker is the same as mine except im stuck gold 3 while playing with plat 3, I have 47% Round win and S in everything else. 

It's just unlucky, keep playing and if you can mantain these performances with consistency, you'll climb, I think I will too, but still ridiculous how well you can perform while not ranking up for quite some time.
What rank are you? I see this a lot because I can't aim and I'm stuck iron/bronze. But I don't think that shit is very common in high rank. Obviously something is seriously wrong with the gameplay of someone stuck in low elo and for a lot of these kids it's just completely not understanding economy. When I said "let's buy" round one this one kid said no you always save round 1 and 2 to full buy round 3 and tried to tell me that's what all the pros do lol. And I'm like so wait what if you win the first round or lose it? You do the same thing no matter what? And he's like yah i have immortal friends that's what they all do. ya right smh
Power level is the most important, then trap durability bonus. All of the other bonuses are negligible so just ignore them
I know a lot about counter strafe, I know how to clutch 1v2s, and everything that is considered basic, it’s just that I can’t put it all together
As someone who plays kbm on every game possable on xbox i am mad
if it makes u feel any better, i’ve been playing since july-august of 2020 and just peaked gold ☠️
I just recently purchased Save the World, and I can’t even get through the tutorial without the screen turning black and the entire game just crashing. Rebooting it does nothing. I get back into Fortnite, start up STW again, watch the same damn cutscene that it’s incessantly stuck at, and then watch as the black screen appears and ruins the entire game. There is no amount of clicking, button/key mashing, or waiting that gives any indication of the game being responsive at that point. It just shits out and there’s nothing I can do about it. Tried contacting Epic support and of course they claim they can’t issue a refund, yet they also didn’t do anything to resolve the issue. So, not the same issue you’re having, but mine’s also glitching out majorly.
is SOL 2.0 in development? or u jsut coping?

considering they were tied to a league event that was a one time thing, i wouldnt think they would make more tbh.
Ventures.
No, there's no way to merge the two accounts but it's unlikely that they've gotten much on the Xbox account anyway that they wouldn't already have on the Switch account. Simply add the Xbox account onto their Epic account and it should carry over the account and everything (except any purchased Vbucks, but items purchased with those Vbucks WILL carry over) from their Switch and for future reference should you kid get a PlayStation or something in he future, don't skip over the account linking at the beginning!

also this is the subreddit for Save the World, a different game from Battle Royale, which is likely what your child plays, that sub is r/fortnitebr
I dont have any either...
try to use wingman dizzy and thrash (twice) as much as possible, if ur only using them once or twice a round ur not abusing gekko, his util bounces and walks back to u for a reason

the moment u start spamming this guys util it’ll be way easier for u, even just the sound of thrash or a dizzy blind can stall teams for 5s+

When you consider the fact that it will take a while for a new player to get to a level where team comp even matters, it’s really not that bad. You only 2-3 agents you enjoy at the start.

Not at all. Being as Coding and Software Development is literally my job I'm well aware of what it takes to implement something and it's NOT as difficult as you think it is. An anti-cheat can detect 3rd Party software and you can literally tweak that to detect a smurf based off certain criteria. It's not impossible for game devs to do it.

As a fellow controller main something I do that pisses yours off is I’ll just plop a smoke at my feet and sit near the edge with a shorty and if they flash in the smoke I’ll back out of it and if they flash outside the smoke I’ll swing out on them when they try and get my team
You could try to photoshop it, probably wouldn't be that hard watching a tutorial or 2
How many people know about that do you think? And how many of those will actually draw something and send it?
Exact same thing happened to me while playing ISO. I was confused why
Every map has a gimmick, it’s part of Riot’s map design philosophy (but reworks and some post-release maps dont follow it as much)
This doesn’t work at all and has been proven time and time again for a multitude of things for learning, weather it be school, learning a new instrument, a sport, etc.

The stats behind it show that when people keep doing something that you can improve at but you DONT KNOW where you’re going wrong you can just be putting wasted time into wasted practice that gives no results. 

Ever heard of noodling on a guitar for 8 hours a day won’t improve you as much as doing scales, chords, and certain technique practices for 2 hours a day.

I get what you’re saying but it’s insanely incorrect and will cause lower level players to stay low level forever and continue to blame teammates and never understand how to properly get better.

Was silver on launch, was gold a year later, now sitting ascendant 3
If you kill people playing off of trades you're in shit elo, got super lucky with the spray transfer or the enemies missplayed it
Mental is crap across the elo, just that the low elo players are too impatient and want to rank up in just a couple of games. They will ruin their own game and RR because of this..
Not to brag but I can get 18/30 on easy bots with a vandal 😎

Throw the game before they throw the game
Check your games. U see the ranks after the match in the Overview.
in higher elos high HS rate correlates to better aim
Unbinding crouch button really made my gameplay better and my hs rate went from 17% to 31%. Went from gold 3 to diamond 2 in two acts
U must miss your ex :/
Happens when most of the playerbase are 14 y/o
Wasn't this posted before?
I think they should add fov slider for this game, the fov it doesn't help, is like playing a console game.
My account is Oz B23 on LAN if you want to check it so you can see what i need to improve, cause i don't even know myself
He left TSM to take care of family apparently. Then he tried to find other teams but couldn’t find anything promising. In between that his crypto wallet got stolen and he lost hundreds of thousands of dollars, probably affecting his mental. Them he joined up with a few other big names like Stewie and Brax to try to qualify for tier 2 challengers. They did whatever and didn’t make it. 

Now he’s just streaming at low numbers and pulls this stunt ruining his reputation further.
Shouldn’t this go under stonks?
Are you aware if progress/purchases carry over to the full release?
na just bad player without any gamesense. there are millions like this. there's a reason 53% of all banned cheaters in valorant did not get reported before.
You shouldnt be able to make posts like this without a vod for review.
Oh yeah that could very well be it. You can practice this in the range on that adjustable dartbord
Let’s share the fun then!!
If you got money to throwaway then yes, if you don't then don't
Comp games are a step up in competitiveness than normal games but with enough ranked games, the level of competitiveness will naturally go down and so with enough games your level of competitiveness (and by proxy your toxicity) can go down to the level of current unrated games.
(Im a bit slow and am still learning the game) 

So Yoru’s ult can be seen similar to how Sovas dart works? Just instead of seeing it is seen?
I wish founders got ray and Lars.
apac teams are EU ascendants
You probably won't wait a year for a karambit btw. I have been playing for 4 months and I have the prime karambit and the reaver karambit... along with many other knives I have always wanted like the xenohunter, reaver knife, oni katana, RGX butterfly, recon balisong, magepunk butterfly, glitchpop dagger etc.
No, what you're talking about is purely spread not recoil decay (how long you have to wait until you can take an accurate shot within the stats parameters of the weapon, ofc). This is best replicated on Desert Eagle in CS. cl\_crosshairstyle 1, fire a single shot while staying still, the crosshair wont reset back to static immediately like it does in Valorant.
turning around to avoid the flash but it doesnt matter in Gekko's case cuz no matter what you get flashed as long as youre in the LOS of it
she's balanced, and ppl dont play her
When ik i have iso on enemy team,I get phantom (i ussualy play vandal)and destroy them.

I bought it because it’s Mr Vbucks himself but I do think STW folk should have gotten him at discounted price, or been able to purchase him with his Vbucks.
The reason I believe the gold bonus might be beneficial is because of the balance of the game. When attackers have 1:40 minutes to work with, it's always advantageous to use most, if not all of the time to weaken enemy defenses. These could include breaking sentinel util to spread out their resources. 

My intention is that this advantage could be balanced out by giving an incentive to play "less optimally" by giving a gold reward. They don't necessarily have to 5 man rush every round, it's just that there's an extra reward there if they do.

Additionally from my experience as a defender, I would much rather deal with rushes than default (stimulation isolation) simulator.
The low elo judge abusers are all justyfing their judge usage why they're  "actually good" and nit no brain no aim. It's  so funny 🤣🤣🤣
This is why I get need a corpse

That loadout sounds absolutely sick! I’d love to play it, I have every hero except for Stoneheart Farrah though :( would you say she’s worth recruiting, or should I just replace her with someone else until she returns?
It's fade 100%
It’s a glitched piece. People get under the maps and everything. Fireburn045 is a YouTuber that shows a lot of glitched builds. I just play normal. For me they are too much work.

I guess because the update makes you a prick(ly)?
Oh , since I am in sg , I always play sg server , sometimes Mumbai server . I get around 80 ping in Mumbai server but it didn't affect me much.
I consider the missing sounds are advantegous for knowing the location of a high threat husk. So I put these specific missing sound issues between "critical" and "major" in my trello.
It is never a hard reset (completely new MMR and rank) and is always a soft reset (maintain your MMR and your rank goes down somewhat) between episodes. There are no resets between Acts.

Id increase her self heal to 50, because 30 is just useless and sometimes its necessary to self heal (esp if last alive). Her heal for others is fine IMO.
Why do people bother posting these clips? You missed mate, get over it and move on. It’s a game. You barely hit the kj there lol
raze is picked literally all the time
I’m high imm. I occasionally play with friends on an alt using a drawing pad and my aim is still usually on high dia/asc level. Even playing in low dia / plat lobbies, I’ve found more success in running it down as an agent going for frags or cleanups rather than actually trying to IGL and win. IGLing almost never works because a player always has some sort of issue accomplishing the task they’ve been assigned lol. For some reason though, playing around your teammates mistakes always ends up in free multi-kills lol
This isn’t what iron looks like that’s why. OP was iron 3 when this happened but they ranked up to bronze 3 a week later.  
you really need to practice good habits lol, see Woohoojin videos and stuff. Also join his discord, and ask for coaching, he can really give you good insights.
A Judge bursting 100 bullets at once? I like that idea.
One of the few things that nearly everyone on this sub tends to agree on is that Deliver the Bug missions are god awful. The fact that Epic ignored how broken they were for years and decided to just no longer let them function as mission alerts instead of fixing them is a testament to just how broken and bad they are.


You considering DtB "pretty fun" is wild to me. I could agree to disagree about a lot of your list, but that? That I just don't understand at all. 
Put 'before' pictures on the left homie
It’s definitely a seekers issue. Had my Skye in a game a couple days ago use seekers in b window on Haven, all 3 seekers went into garage so we pushed b. Directly into a KJ with a shotgun waiting in b main. By her own words, she did not move all round.

It’s hard to say without proper VOD. Probably you have some habits that may be blocking your performance. So maybe try to record some games and share them so someone could check. I can try to take a look too (I’m Asc 2, and was climbing from gold for a while so I know the path :))

Blyrb and I believe that Deadly Blade Crash was the cause of the snare that you're seeing.
Oh ok
Still looking for that one game company that actually cares about their playerbase instead of squeezing every single cent out of everyone.
The soldier class in general isn't particularly great, not to say it's bad. They lack the mobility, utility, and crowd control that the other classes have. Personally, I'd recommend an outlander with TEDDY. Great mobility, efficient resource gathering, and TEDDY gives an extra set of hands if your teammates aren't pulling their weight. You should definitely still prioritize learning to build efficiently though. Oh, and do research on the hero's/weapons before you slot them into your collection book. Nothing hurts more than having to spend legendary flux to unslot then later
yes,  i started a custom once and went to check out the music. i’ve never heard it in game before though
I have seen people getting almost 40 kills in one game while in others they were struggling. That's completely irrelevant to this. People can have outstanding kills once in a while.

BTW, can you share your tracker?
Yeah it’s kinda the new tactic as I understand it, win a bunch of rounds with it on, then turn it off and finish the game out.
There is no conpetive advantage in the video game Fortnite.
Lies bro I’m bodyshot Barry with shitty game sense and plat 2 ranking up to 3(20 hs)
The whole idea that low elo is just clueless brainless players is triggering to me lol. 

Literally everyone I fight knows how to strafe / counter strafe to some extent. 

I've experienced really good sentinels, really good duelists, really good controllers. The whole nine yards. People are plenty skilled in low elo. 

And I kid you not, I say this again : low elo knows how to strafe / peek. 

No it's not as polished as High elo but does it need too?
Does it happen in both "views" of the ability?
>You can always give strong duos weaker teammates until the duo advantage is balanced quantitatively. Even the top two players in the world, playing together, aren't strong enough to overcome a sufficiently determined matchmaker.

You can't do this without absolutely demolishing queue times, or match quality though.     The skill gap between even top Pro's and mid radiant players is gigantic.    You either need to basically drive queue times into 40+ mins so you can guarantee both teams are all pro's and/or top like 5% of radiant players who all happen to be on at the same time and close enough to a centralized server location.   

Or a matchmaker basically has to saborage games so pro's are stuck with like low immortal teammates against an opposing team of radiants who will eviscerate the immortal players.   Which is complete horseshit for the immortal players.  

Of course in general pro's basically hit radiant while goofing off and messing around so it's not like matchmaking really has to worry about a bunch of pro duo's trying their heart out.     And if pro's happen to hit absolutely stupid win rates like 65%+ at radiant then so be it.
discord -> rxnii.

Asc - Since everyone is talking split- I’ll throw in my two cents. If I play sage on split and it’s defense, I will typically wall mid every round UNTIL they shoot it out immediately. And then from there on I expect that to continue so I save it.

And when I’m on attack, if they wall mid I always take the time to run over there and shoot it out so they need someone to cover mid.
I identify as being right
Knife also ruins all of my beautiful cypher setups :(
Looks like the hotel from left 4 dead 2
I don’t get it
I don't think it's just that... ngl. Cause on VCT there's just so much spamming with the Vandal and Phantom. Also DRX vs PRX on Pearl, whole team tries to plant, dies one by one to spam.
He's completely right though, reyna 100% easiest character to play especially in low elo
Lower your sens
It is a random selection each day from the list of available gun skins (such as those that you have not already purchased, are not exclusive, not part of a battlepass, etc).

There is no reduction of chance of getting the same skin repeat times in a short period.
Over priced don't buy
1. K/D is misleading when I have 202 ADR. 2. The enemy ranks were very close to mine, except for one who was likely smurfing. 3. My entire team performed horrendously and I was stuck playing retake simulator after 2 or 3 of my teammates are dead within literally 10 seconds of the barrier going down every round. In spit this, I still outperformed everyone on the enemy team, except for one person who was, once again, most likely smurfing. 4. Holy fuck, the reddit horde is dumb as fuck. Please consider drinking antifreeze.
He can still snowball at the start of the round, but now you wont see him with shields late into the round anymore
33 Diamond 2 currently
Just pray you start ct
fair enough, maybe its less arcadey now
And he does surprisingly well with Yoru, and since everyone is taking comp seriously, they can't dodge if he's the last to lock in, and then he proves the whole lobby wrong if they say Yoru is a trollpick
Xenohunter or Magepunk Sparkswitch

How are you playing your deathmatches? Are you just running around wide swinging everything with no care about placing your crosshair on commonly held angles?

One can have the most amazing ability to flick and have raw aim, but that person will still lose to someone who is ready to just click or just micro-adjust because their crosshair placement is good.

Work your DMs down slowly, clear every commonly held angles you would find in a ranked and don't care about you fragging out
I hope so dude
I'm confused as to what part of this is supposed to be bannable
I would pay real life money to hear the enemy’s comms
Absolutely, loot boxes = bad. I would really like to know what percentage of the sales from these skins end up on the designated teams and on the pro player's hands. I would definitely love if at the end of the day, pro players got really good revenue from these since salaries are a major issue on the competitive scene.

I just honestly think that as costumers, at this point in Valorant we have much better options to choose from in terms of skins, and for lower prices. In my honest opinion, I don't feel inspired to buy anything by the look and price of these skins.

Thank you, appreciate it!

If you enjoyed it, there are way better people out there that play Judge than me. Maybe they are not strictly Judge only but they use it a lot. Check out Dasnerth and Quarky if you want to see the highest level of shotgun gameplay.
Maybe 10 matches
I’m currently power 108 but I want to unlock MSK
Loser mentality and your friends suck.

Get fucked.
Thank you, putting DM and Ranked games first and range last is a good tip 😊
Which dev thought of Reyna as an agent is deffo a Smurf himself
It will be a phantom or vandal. They won’t mess around with a once a year bundle and risk losing money over it
Then just don't buy it.Simple you guys know Riot they just want your guys paper they don't care about putting alot of effort.Just forget it

I’d agree reaver and prime. I bought them both and they just never scratch the itch for me. Always find myself going back to the prelude to chaos
Ppl don’t often consider all the branching effects a change can have. They isolate the issue and come up with a black & white fix and think it’s just so easy to fix this one issue.
Raze is the one with the rocket launcher- be careful though, you can kill your self with it 😂😂 I learned that the hard way
Why does it matter? The moment you stop caring so much about the things you can’t control and start concentrating on the things you can change is when youll rank up
I don't think higher sensitivity will help. Lower fps means you will have a harder time smoothly aiming and adjusting. For what my opinion is worth, I suppose it could be better if you swap to sheriff (for occasional long range fights) + judges / buckies which doesn't rely on precise aiming and see where that leads you.

Sage deflecting missiles
Imo the main reason is B long is just awful to push. After getting through, there is just too many spots for CT to hold angles from. What’s bad is the spike zone is literally around a corner after pushing long which is awful and forces weird exchanges. Then mid is just really hard to push . a is just too easy to t side . They need to open up  b long for starters
Any clues when ?
I mean most of the subreddit seems to agree on making your guns shadowshard/sunbeam. Making your guns obsidian will lower the DPS and Damage. You want to deal as much damage/crit damage/crit rating as possible
or just anti-material charged both the mats and the raptors.
There is still a huge gap between immo 1 and immo 3. The skill difference is really high. I would compare this gap with bronze to asc. at least. Thats my oppinion tho…
What about the timer? Because that part is nerfed, should the time be increased?

On an eco if you're buying a sheriff, chances are you aren't killing any semi-decent iso with how long it takes between shots especially to re-aim at the head, and by that time you've been sprayed down or traded headshots.

On the second round if you win pistol, buying an outlaw is almost always awesome cuz you aren't buying full armor after losing pistol unless ur forcing right? Yeah, Iso literally just tanks that first shot so you pray that you land the second fast enough before he one deags you 

I'm glad he's getting nerfed, he's terrorizing high elo where gunfights last 1-2 shots sometimes, he just solos. He takes the skill out of the game and honestly his whole agent idea doesn't fit in the tactical shooter genre that Val and CSGO are in.
The Neon weapon series sword. It's not terrible, but it doesn't really have any article-worthy value. It's also super common to run into
This.
Main sens is 0.94 1600 dpi lol
You just seem to be denying something that has been proven multiple times. Can't fix that.

Potshot is a lot better yeh .i have both weapons maxed and the plasma gun is funny to use ,strong enough to kill all type of enemy .The potshot is all that in a higher Level. And looks better 🙄 . But u dont get a voucher Back if u used one and to get this gun u need to wait a few month or u must use a voucher. I would wait .
Boredom + excess materials from outlander farming lol
There are cheaters in Valorant BUT far less then in any other online fps game. The thing is, most public stuff gets detected often by Riot so people just stop because they ban your hardware. Ofc private, small communities exists and if a coder is skilled enough he can make it work. I am talking aimbot here, because wh will get detected always since you directly read the memory unlike aim that can detect color so it's an external program but it still needs to be hidden well from anticheat.
This is pretty spot on. Only nuance I'd add is that if you're dead you can help your team set up plays and crossfires. Which can technically be backseating but you can mitigate it with the way you comm. "Hey jett can you hold short for a crossfire with sage"?
[removed]
are you me? lol

anyways go deathmatch, range is useless. doesnt really matter if you just keep dying, its good anyways.
Pafter your specs tell me. You Pc has been cleaned how much time ago and Do you live close to te beach?
>Crouch spraying and bad hygiene in dms will never help you actually improve, so this builds discipline

Where you from? Bc I don't have a habit of crouch spray but the enemy in front of me always do that and kills me, hell even they strafe and hit only body. No one cares for head, there's no bad hygiene. Tbh I'm learning how to crouch spray bc that will only gives a win. Tracking head and shit never works, people win fights with rng, crouch spray, holding angles and crouching spray to, no one plays well. That's why I've to play like ass to get a win. It's the rule.
Looks better than most builds I’ve been seeing in 160s lately.
I dont think theres a tap strafing in valorant, at least not widely used. I think you got it confused with apex where tap strafing is one of the staple movement 'mechanics' 

Your opponents do stand still more than ideal, but im guessing its just a skill issue, i bet youd see better opponents when you eventually rank up higher
But not in her regular dismiss?
Like everyone said so far. Ignoring is the best thing. But the better thing to do is to be a better player than them. Ergo, keep your KDA superior. Use that as leverage at the end of the game to let reality sink in.
Spam deathmatches, you can shorten to proccess like 10x
I am not going to complain with this, I’m gonna be feasting on these rewards, I’m currently leveling stuff up and this is going to be very helpful
This does not makes much sense, seems more like a mental thing, but if you want to see you could compare stats of the players between stopping for the next day and not stoping.

I know stats are not everything but its the easiest way.
so sick!
Does this look like a battle royale subreddit?

We play fortnite here... not the former... there is no nintendo switch version of the game. Post in the right subreddit, and at the very least do a little due diligence to find the right one PRIOR to posting in the wrong one.
Source enough that different people say the same thing. 
So somewhere obviously that information comes from.

I literally said I just want a couple for the msk. And I’m going to trade fairly for them. You are a wet blanket cuh
just let it fail or leave. fuck carrying people who are actively against helping or winning. open the walls up, or destroy the defense and then leave. Let them scramble to try and not lose, which they undoubtedly will.

Try to talk, if they're nice then cool, if they're not then mute. people really do suck in this game for no reason.
You dont! Move on, and if you cant, you have a much bigger problem than this video game.
if you're going for radiant maybe, but even then its possible without. anyone can make it to immortal without saying a word
Just ask to join someone low level and you will get access to all missions. You only have 3 days left.
it’s also so much faster to say and type CT / T
i heard if you dodge a map, you’re more likely to queue into that map right after
I wouldn't get caught up in the dpi crap. Been playing pro cs since 2008. Always used 400 dpi even on 1080p. With that being said, 400 dpi, .68 in game.
Yeah, time to pack up STW next.
wingman is so cute
what a run from prx. hopefully they will come back stronger in champs. great job to EG tho. ggwp

Tencent has stakes in reddit
Yeah, I used to one-trick miner deck and the card was good. People were making fun of him bcs he was not reliable as single win-condition. He was good tank and combine that with being able to place him anywhere on the map - it's chipp damage, tank for like loon/lava or support for giant pushes and his good usage on defense.
PLS give me a code for eu ps5 ty gang
exactly as aim assist should be in every fps game…
Not OP but yeah, daily missions and random vbuck missions can net you a good amount. I've gotten about 1k or so in the last week.
I use a small thin translucent cyan crosshair, as cyan contrasts yellow best—I also use yellow enemies.
I think he means placement matches when he says unrated, not sure though.

Fear is just an issue with your focus. If you can find positive things to feel good about from every game you lose (whether it was a positive k/d, a great round you had or figuring out a line up) you’ll probably see the fear go away. You’re much more likely to improve at the game if you allow yourself to have fun. I’ve climbed 2 ranks this way with a losing record in episode 8-2 (32-36).
They never sent me mine
I disagree , maybe viable in lower rank idk but I watched a guy named root(radiant) even he was struggling with it to when he went from plat to immo outlaw only . I am usually in high diamond - low ascendant lobbies but even here it's so hard to get picks . People just don't peak if u are attacking or in defense too they will flush the whole site with utility. Also people have sick aim with sherifs in these lobbies which makes it even more hard .  Also it is hard to retake with outlaw in defense rounds when they have whole site control.
That's right. Lower your head and bow to your intellectual overlord. If you study hard enough under the teachings of sensei jin you may potential reach 5% of my brain activity. Truly an achievement for anyone of peasant capabilities
Just download windows and play val
Arabic server is a nightmare. I always try a match in each server to see the kinds of players. When I selected Bahrein, I wanted to forget that experience. They scream, They play awful, They put music woth microphone on, They blame a lot even if they are the worst and the only English "phrases" I heard from them are: "Bro!" "Fucking noobs!".
I played an entire episode to see I was wrong, but I wasn't.
Really, a nightmare 😅😂
Was hardstuck at silver 1 and then reached gold 2 after i changed my mouse sensitivity to 0.33 the difference in aiming was big.
What did they say?
Holy shit


The active camo
my friend who used judge to diamond (which he achived again and again)  


the enemy team hates him to the end.
I’m curious
Well... Hard stuck iron/bronze on a 60hz crappy notebook.
Played on a 144hz 34' monitor and reached silver.
Bought me a 240hz 27' monitor, playing with 240+fps I just reached Silver 3 for the first time ever.
Yeah, refresh rate makes a hell of a difference
no
Where are you supposed to aim with the bucky, headshots or like top of the circle at the top of the head
Where is it called rarity in the UI? Maybe I'm mistaken but I'm pretty sure it's referred to as tier.
I may be misunderstanding you, but... No, you need to play to take VALUABLE ground, which will often not be empty. It is your opponents' responsibility to defend this space. It is your responsibility to disappoint them.
Bro IS the game
I think 42% vandal hs is higher than the averages I usually see in immortal
that 3rd account you linked "AHAHAHAHAH" is JeyG! and JeyG has used it to duo with him (as a smurf) on stream
This. It’s insanely boring to play against.
Someone donate a code 🙏🙏
not really no, even the VCT observers look at players taking the actual gunfights rather than the support player providing the necessary information in order for them to get the frags.

i don't like it, but i can see why they'd think the audience wants to see "pew pew" instead of the person using his cam to provide round winning info.
DM or team DM, don’t care about the result I just want to feel crispy. The second I do, I Q comp
What a nice day to, initiated!
Right? A year should be more than enough time to learn all the major call outs. Especially since a lot of the call outs are shared between a large number of the maps or are very self explanatory.
Similar to yours but a full team Killjoy lockdown. When she says "Got them alllll." Definitely top tier
I got her so long ago that I couldn't remember where from.

As a self proclaimed (pro) cypher main here's what you want to do on attack. If the duelist enters do as you say. If they don't, do this. Watch flanks. Most likely you'll get a kill. After it becomes a 4v1 wait near  a trip. Most likely they'll push you and boom 3v1. Hide in an off angle and boom 2v1 or 1v1. Then just pray.

Tell me you’re a noob without telling me you’re a noob.

I said not all duelists should be taking first contact, and not all duelists are entry.

Jett should not be the first person peeking B main on Ascent for example, because you need them alive to execute a site entry, so it would suck if they got dinked in the beginning of the round.

Reyna is not an entry duelist, she’s as dead as anyone else if she just walks on to site with just her blinds, she needs support from her team and arguably will do the most damage if her team can get her successfully onto the site.

I know we’re leagues apart with rank, don’t explain the game to me.
Is there any source for china having it? 

I've never seen this mentioned outside of reddit comments. Any screenshots or videos of the replay feature in China would be a really good source
Sage main since act 1 . Wall is OP . I need to heal myeslf too cause i cant headshot people so i take some damage while i shoot them in the body 4 times .
Rightly so

I would ask more about why he got bored.  Being that skilled at something doesn't usually lead to boredom, and I'm sure he's aware of the esports scene in Valorant and twitch community/opportunities.  My concern would be that "bored" really means "frustrated"
Hardstuck silver for 5 Months. Wanted to get better. 2-3 months of aim labs(not just flicking actual useful stuff) and watching coaching videos. I’m now stuck plat.
I use different sens from .205 800 dpi to .27 and one thing id say is dont be scared to change your sens and worry that it will make you more inconsistent. Go to range and if you feel like your hand flicks slow then go higher and if your shaky go slower.. Take your time when you shoot your shot. I never learned how to spray and ive been playing for a while. Iron 3 placement 2 yrs ago and peak asc 3 90+ rr. (Been dia when asc wasnt a thing). Youll see a lot of pros changing sens as well and everyone for sure is "inconsistent" we'll have our bad days. Your mentality will affect your aim a lot, sens is just another thing. You dont really have to flick a lot in this game mostly micro adjustment from your crosshair placement. But anyhow i cant get to immo so  take my advice or not is for you to decide
Anybody got a code?
Totally agree. Thinking about taking a couple days off comp and just finding out what the problem is. Doing some aimlabs, DM, TDM, etc. until I get to the point I feel good again. I think parts of it is that when I don’t feel like I can hit the shot, i rush it, I start doing all kinds of dumb things that get me killed. Clearing the head and taking emotion out of it is clearly needed. Thanks!
People who use this sub to vent will never listen to what they need to hear. Let them stay in pisslow elo where they belong. No immortal+ player wants them on their team anyway. There are enough cry babies as it is. The last thing we need is to have some of these people make just barely a big enough of an adjustment so that they manage to q in a lobby with people that actually know how to play the game.
Fine then team deathmatch
Sometimes I will go like 1-11 simply because I keep getting shot from behind and such but then in like second half I’ll win every gunfight
Okay bro. I was trying to say I got the strongest weapon in the game, not that necessarily I want to use a bow build. But is there any other hero other than stonehart that can deal insane damage in venture?
let us eat
its a bit of an awkward mixup of combat constructor and BASE constructor. not to say its bad, it can be a good idea to mix up half defensive and offensive. sometimes you don't want play a dedicated support character but still want to help out, and it can just be a great pick for solo builds.

i'd advise throwing BASE kyle in lead, he is arguably the best single thing in the game as his extra health allows you to tank smashers an minibosses. throwing a few more defensive BASE perks in your support team can help too, but they're not essential. its can be good and fun to throw 5 whole offensive support perks into your support squad and dish out some raw damage alongside a good BASE commander's power.

a full BASE loadout with 5x supercharged traps is best, but one of my favorites is the boom BASE team perk for a ghetto TRO/war cry. its a nice little buff with 100% permanent uptime for the whole team, giving everyone some nice offensive power. and since its activated by some of the extremely overpowered musical heroes, you can use it for both great all-around ranged damage or for great kinetic impulse melee builds with syd.

High sens is fine if your willing to put in the time on aim trainers to gain the mouse control to be able to handle it. Doesn’t mean it’s ever going to be as consistent as lower sens but you can get close. Ur match history and rank shows that you are not there yet. 

I have trash aim but great crosshair placement and movement. I play on 200 edpi. You would never in a million years catch me going 9-17 in a silver lobby. Crosshair placement alone is enough to demolish these ranks. your sens is too high and you are struggling to pre aim. Some times the flicks hit sure, but that’s not what you should rely on.
If they add shields its over
If you play in a higher-than-your-current elo, you get a performance bonus for playing well.

That's AK. How about the other 30 guns?
okay so this post doesnt apply to you
Thank you
I see a lot of Omen, but tbh Harbor is the best in that role of "Not a duelist but should be played as entry". 

The amount of flood you can make, clear sites, deny info, make space, cover your allys and get some picks is amazing. You can even play him as lurker in defensive rounds, flooding the enemy from behind also generates a lot of presure for them to make mistakes. 

Omen is fine and all, and should also be played as duelist/initiator. But I'm sure Harbor is better at that.
Honestly applies to tons of ranks. Talk, even if its jusr stuff like "x and y agent util on b" that info might be useless for you but for the person on the other side it means they only have to potentially look for util from 3 agents instead of all 5. Depending on their setup it means you sus out a solo hold and just can bully it or if you dont see anything then you can contact a site and full exec.
Anyone gotta invite for me 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

That is okay because I think you are the virgin.
diamond and ascendant players do not know how to comm nor do they know how to attack. people will blame the losses on lack of comms instead of the lack of util usage, the lack of space being taken, and the lack of cohesiveness between teammates and what everyone is doing
i dont think she needs buffs, shes already crazy buffed and that doesnt work. she needs a rework at this point to see play in casual.
Can they ban you when you haven’t done anything wrong? I think just because you get reported a lot doesn’t necessarily mean you get banned. If you haven’t done anything wrong I guess there’s nothing to worry about. If I’m not mistaken, the others could risk their own accounts getting suspended or banned if they falsely report other players.

Actually you'd be in the spawn still waiting for another cunt calling another timeout
this is tactical shooter game, everyone should get kills to win a round
What?
What loadout do you generally use? Do you build trap tunnels etc. or just a basic build and use weapons to defend?
Always maintain similar sensitivity in whatever game you play.
My 65 year old mom was able to hit platinum with zero FPS game experience before Valorant not counting Goldeneye 64 . If she can do that you can hit surely diamond as long as you have a decent set up and enough free time. If you throw up a VOD on YouTube I can leave you some comments about what you maybe can do to improve.
Ok what’s the difference
🙈🙈🙈🙈
No way, I just hit 500 like a few days ago, too! Good luck, commander, we believe in you!
I just really dislike the approach here:  


**How dare you guys try to bring to Epic's attention that after 6 years of complaints, your only resource is to post in the official STW sub-reddit?**  
**This is so wrong, please let's only post positive stuff, do not bring your frustration about being boxed, told your IP will be shared, have your mats wasted cause someone is destroying your base or they are simply AFK here, we won't tolerate it.**  


Are you serious? How out of touch can you be? I thought that toxic positivity was an exaggeration, but this thing is a clear example of it.
Hate to break it to you, but even pros and Radiants miss shots.
Video games are similar to many sports, just without the physical aspect, hence the name esports. In the same way, many sports are games, they're quite literally called so. The onlynreal difference between the two is one requires a lot morenohysicsl exertion than the other. Many people invest quite a bit of resources into improving themselves to be better at a sport, because it makes them feel good, as improving should. To a lot of people, sports and esports are more than just games, it's a part of their life, and naturally they would want to improve that aspect of their livee. Human beings like to give meaning to things, otherwise they are meaningless.
Peak, pique, peek... they all sounds the same. I'm sure you'll figure it out
Not entirely true. It also explodes/expands once it reaches it's full travel time. Still not super large, but it is much larger than the initial beam.
Same here to :( and after game finish i cant push try again need out to lobby before i Can start a new game
You don't have to go down that far. This happens in bronze too lol
It means you can’t go back
Great, he loved the reply!
The way they did it is weird, they said you'd get 5 friend invites but all they gave was 1 redeem code for store. I have another because I did it twice one with my main and a second random new email and somehow got lucky
It did work
Unrated matchmaking will have a much higher chance of “weird” matches than something like ranked. Both queues use an MMR system, but their numbers are independent from one another. Here are a couple factors that contribute to why you might see weird matchmaking in unrated:

* High ELO players often do not play unrated, so when they do, they are frequently shuffled into lower ELO games so that they have a reasonable queue time.
* There is no queue restriction in unrated. If an Immortal player wants to play with his Bronze friend, it is up to the matchmaker to put both of them in a game *somewhere*.
* The MMR confidence interval for unrated is just wider than it is for ranked.
* You might play worse or better in unrated than you do in ranked, artificially inflating/deflating your “skill” from what you think you might equate to in ranked.
* Level is not used in any form of matchmaking for any queue - it is only a measure of time played, not skill.
The answer is people got better
You picked Oddjob didn't you?
Higher FPS still matters if your monitor can't display the frames as it reduces input lag.
Yeah you’re boosted. A solo queue Diamond is good enough to be Diamond even with all that. You aren’t.

The fact you believe this in the post outlaw world is telling
I main omen, whenever the enemy team uses the omen ult always look behind you or in your spawn they usually go back there to get an easy flank kill, And when playing omen id suggest to use your tp to gain different angles on high boxes or something I like to do on pistol round is get a shorty and smoke the most popular enterance tp in smoke and get an easy kill.
You should look at the minimal anytime you are not in active danger. I.e. you’re following someone, you’re playing off someone’s contact, rotating with your knife out, reloading etc.

I think you’re overthinking the character.  Your smokes are by far your most important ability, so learning where/when to smoke is going to be way more beneficial than learning some YouTube tp cheese plays that might get you 1-2 extra kills in a game.  

That being said brim is probably the best agent for what you’re describing.  You’ll have some transferable skills from playing another smokes character and brims kit is one of the simplest in the game.  As brim you pretty much just throw your smokes and stim beacon at the start of the site hit/retake and run at em.  Since your util doesn’t recharge all you have to do at that point is focus on shooting people.
A lot of motion blur disappears. When you jump, you see a lot less ghosting, and it's just generally smoother overall.

But serious what is this?

Nah, that's cope. Your individual matches obviously have an element of luck to them, but playing well will not only carry your team to victory, but it will mean you earn more RR from a win than you lose from a defeat.

Depends. Playing with people that are higher in ranks (meaning playing consistently) will boost your skills over time since you're learning from better players. If those friends are the same rank, or lower, it isn't smart to 5stack if you plan on becoming better.
Selling accounts goes against TOS!
Yeah, the lack of the pullout sucks, but the main draw for me was sound and RGX nails that.

The inspect changes the RGB color of the gun each time, which allows for cool combinations.
I have friends who play League extensively and they all think there needs to be a proper voice chat feature.
That should definitely be easily solved. U know ur setup more than I do, but whether it’s a need of larger mouse mat(which is very cheap, alternatively use something else) or sit somewhere else where u would have more space physically on the table if that’s the issue.

In pro play all teams have a dedicated "OPer" which tries to get the Operator most rounds, but especially on defense. This generally is also the meta even in lower ranks. But it can require some teamplay since the sniper will need others to cover for him once the enemies get close range, so it's not as meta in lower ranks.

VOD reviews are good, but sadly, most Vod reviews i've seen on youtube are like from Dia and above. But there, people play way differently, than people on silver.   
and watching youtube videos of radiant pros sounds good, but honestly, i have the same problem there as well: I can't tell what and why what they did were good, and if they just swung it and are so skilled, they just made it work, or if it was ctually a pretty good play.

Yeah exactly so the actual reason is not just player count.

I’m not saying keep your eye peeled on the minimap, check it time to time to see what are your teammates doing, who have they spotted or where are they holding.
Hmm, not sure, that does seem strange wording but I think it's just 2 overall, I'm pretty sure the issue you're having is the survivor though. You may have rescued one and not noticed it was part of the relay, that's how you got 1 out of the 2. Just check all along the ground when you activate it, there should be one there

I returned a fully upgraded Radiant Entertainment System Phantom.  My "Order History" list like your did not show my RP purchases, only my VP purchases.  Maybe you're in a different spot?  

I went [here](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045674593-How-to-Request-a-Refund-VALORANT-Player-Support) and clicked how to refund weapon skins on the left then checked order history.  All my skin purchases were there with a refund request button.  I got my VP and the RP I had spent on the upgrades back within a few minutes.  When I check now it says "you have nothing available for an in game refund" so my one time has been used.

Either way I wanted to confirm that it is truly a one time exception, and it does work on upgraded skins.
Those things you mentioned are mechanics, not fundamentals. 

Mechanically, in valorant there are different ways to throw smokes. You can have walls like viper, you can insta smoke with jett, etc but fundamentally smokes function the same way in both games. You deploy a smoke/wall, the enemy is blocked off from vision. You can shoot through the smokes. You can flash through the smokes. You can sit in the smokes. If you walk through the smokes you are at disadvantage. Same thing fundamentally, see?
Many newer players don't use minimap, and hold angles where enemies literally cannot peak without killing your teamates first. So if your team pushes up,  you should either push with them, or go hold an angle that enemies can actually peak.

Why did you cry? They aren‘t even old enough to use condoms yet so their words mean shit
You are absolutely correct but due to her kit being so valuable, there is a reason why she has the most pick rate and performs the best. Most players in higher elo have played enough games to know how to take advantage of her kit.
Also it doesn’t 1 shot headshot, has a windup time to be at max fire rate and has 3x the first shot inaccuracy (and spread) meaning it loses a lot of 1v1s unless you’re already spamming a corner
yeah its just a way for riot to be like "hey we're giving you cool stuff" where in reality its just another one of the many tactics they use to make people play more
watcging people play val on console is so painful idk why 😭 nice ace tho
Don't worry you'll find out when pearl comes back to competitive play in another 27 months
Yeah.  My daughter also did a party and she also got stuck in a car.   Someone finally shot the car so she could get out.  Crazy.  Definitely a bug

Holy fuck dude... Stop tagging me.

Agreed 100%

If you're actually getting so upset about your performance in-game that it's affecting your life you should seriously consider taking a break. You can practice if you want to be better, of course, but I don't think it's a healthy relationship to the game if you feel like you *need* to be better or you can't enjoy it.
HUGE CROSSHAIR  plus a very nice shot on the last guy wpwp
I still don't agree with you that climbing as a controller is easier. Very different games but I'm a master player from Apex and OW. Two different beasts compared to Valorant, but I'm certain I'll climb much faster and with much more ease if I started investing as much time I did for those games to Valorant. It's just easier to stack points as a duelist. Provided, I have somewhat of my aim down. My two main problems are moving while I shoot and only playing a few games every week. But even if I wasn't as good with my aim, it's just easier to get kills as a duelist. I'm pretty sure you're the outlier as a controller that gets as many kills as often.
If they're all 130, then your level should be higher even if the personalities don't all match.

Have you been collecting your research points?
Where’s that
Always
STW?
I know, where is the setting in the app?
Dont think its necesarrily omens fault lol, I still dont even know what the new agent does. No1 plays her in my games ever.
True, but I imagine people at higher ranks put a bit more thought into their picks, like based on what would benefit the team/ would work well on certain maps. 

I wouldnt know though. I'm literally iron, hahah
hey bb im greydragondom, i need to talk with you, send me a chat
Aussie servers?
Not really, but I played a couple games today and it didn't happen when I lagged, hopefully it's fixed or something
No, you're not.
Last is too late, 3rd or 4th player is more ideal.
Okay but how many skins does the average player have? Like 5-10 at the absolute maximum? No one buys every skin. The figure is still pretty close to 700
To be fair, the miniboss is in lieu of up to four storm modifiers, and I’ll take a miniboss over explosive/healing death burst.
Wait a second, how did he cook so hard with this. Singularity 2.0 when?
t19 should be a really good start at this point in my experience. Pretty sure the weeklies + the games you play to finish the weeklies should get you most of the way there. Obviously the more games you play on top of those games will get you there faster so I'd suggest just playing some extra games a week after finishing the weeklies to secure it. gl!
well im 100% new too and the game seems pretty easy while my friends that played on pc and know mechanics are doing pretty mediocre at best in my lobbys i dont want to sound like i think im better but it just seems weird to me that we got placed the same rank
I stopped using comms because of toxicity. In so many games people only use comms when they want to throw an insult at you. Then they go silent again, until the next insult.
This happened to me too even without the Cypher ult, check out this clip
https://outplayed.tv/media/EZYMGQ
News flash, Riot cares about a safe space for their gamers and that's it.  


GenZ's ruined the game.
idfc if I get back to my old rank with 50% winrate. the whole problem is the amount of time it takes to achieve that in the first palce, what part of that is confusing to you?

>, if you notice anything that needs to be improved please let me know, every advice will be appreciated, thanks.

You're silver so everything still needs to be improved.  However saying everything isn't helpful since trying to fix everything all at once is the wrong way to improve.

That being said, a vod is the only thing that will give us context on which thing out of everything you should focus on.  Chances are it'll be gunfight mechanics since you're a low rank player.  But still, vod reviews are the best way to get the help you need.  Until then, your tracker alone means nothing.
Thanks
It isn't much about coorditation, you can't really expect silvers to think and operate like radiants, if they want to play it its one thing you see valorant at the end of things is a game and you ahould be able to pick anything without persecution, the real problem is picking because "me no like your pick"
Fair tbh. He kinda earned that untrustworthyness himself. Would still personally recommend him as it was usefull before the drama and objectively nothing can change that.
It’s a superb owl.  🦉
Rank inflation wouldn't matter when talking about percentages.

Let's say the ranks weren't inflated as much as they are right now, a D1 player would be pushed to maybe plat 3 or plat 2. This would then mean that the top 85% of players has moved to P3, or P2. Making our comparison to the average the same, with the exception that D1 players are now closer to the top 10-12%.
ever since spectre nerf ive preferred stinger or for the same money i can get a mini odin

de-escalation


its a dumb game mode, don't take it too seriously
I believe that is only said in comparison to CSGO, another tactical shooter with a similar format. I don’t think anyone calls valorant beginner friendly in comparison to like COD.
This is a technique known as Xantares Peek. 
Originated in CSGO. When you are close to me, you will move much more faster than you would if you were at a considerable distance. That is because this would be more of a sudden jerk rather than anticipation. As such this is it

Yes icebox is ass , yes i got 7 icebox games in a row
Should they be training in TDM this early? They don’t even have access to ranked yet, so it might be better to just do swiftplays and unranked to learn the maps, while *also* learning default plants/executes/defenses, and of course practicing ability usage and aim. Then later using DM/TDM to improve on mechanics. But game knowledge and map knowledge is important before hopping into ranked as well.

If you just want the pickaxes, then you'll have to get your commander level(numer top right) to nearly max. It's not a 1 or 2-day thing. You'll need to complete hundreds of missions or build an afk canny endurance. You'll get around 2 levels per endurance. 
You can also join the Minerva discord and see if you can join people for 160s which will give a lot of commander xp

I understand that people tell you to play comp but i strongly advise againdt it if you know that you wont be able to perform good, it gets surprisingly hard when you are in the lowest elos and i think ranking mid bronze when you are more confident will just be way more fun than grinding your way out of iron.

It’s a troll ass map. Huge and griefers will have a field day
Can't you get it from Expeditions? Specifically the Crafting Material ones?
Think of it like this, it's the internet, you're practically anonymous. They don't know who you are and what you do.

You invite them, they want to play, y'all get to have fun.   
You invite them, they don't want to play, they won't get mad.  
At this point, just move on and find other people. You'll find the one that will want to play with you

Good luck my friend
It’s been bunz, was D1 last act and placed silver 3. Now my silver games are a mix of real silvers and plat/Dia kids that are silver

I dont know why people act like smurfing isn't cheating. By definition it is. Just because Riot's TOS doesn't explicitly disallow smurfing doesn't mean it's not cheating.
the only thing a keyboard could be helping with here is possibly lower actuation points so releasing a/d faster but in val that's all you have to do release your movement key and you instantly have full accuracy no need to counterstrafe to get it like in cs, that is why the new razer/wooting feature is an actual advantage for that game.
There are a few people from epic here so might be worth a shot

Is it possible to select your own servers? I'm a EU player myself (from the Netherlands), but one match I'm playing on London servers, one match later it connects me to Frankfurt, then to Paris... it's random every time. :|
Wow someone that actually read the post rules and is just wondering why it is, this community is growing 
HIS ULT IS A MORDE ULT LMFAO
don't worry man, you'll do good. Just enjoy the game like you used to and you'll automatically rank up, and even if you don't, it's alright right? Having fun is more important.
Furthermore, my experience in iron-silver is near identical, except the people there are slightly better in terms of gamesense (not necessarily since most irons can't even be considered having gamesense at all). 

Only from gold onwards, games tend to get a little harder and people tend to comm more, and more teamwork is needed. And honestly, it's pretty much the same throughout plat and diamond, with the players getting quicker with their reflexes and it just comes down to which team has more teammates who can cooperate better.

You will meet some braindead teammates on your way though, but that's a minority compared to the amount of games you'll meet people of your skill level. And once you do get to diamond, it's pretty much learning all the other tricks, outplaying others and having better strats ( since most people are mechanically decent at that point).  Also, try not to autopilot too much if you're wanting to improve at a faster rate. By that, I mean to think before doing anything. Like plan out your entire strat during the buying period. 

Finally, hope u had a great time playing and will continue to do so in the future :) have a nice day!
I check the edges of the map all the time
then its better to play harbor and switch to astra later on once you actually know what you're doing. controller is a tough role, its not just about smoking chokes or blocking LoS, controller needs to understand timing, a perfectly timed smoke can stall a enemy rush single handedly, plus you need to be aware of all enemy positioning so you can place the smokes in the correct direction. 

harbor is better to start investing time learning controller since his abilities are pretty straightforward. but astra on the other hand requires stars to be placed before using her utilities, and most of the time, low elo players always die while using util and not having gun in hand
I'm 44. My typical crew consists of a 43 and a 42-year-old (both of whom are dads) and a 36-year-old. Occasionally the 22-year-old nephew of one of the guys joins us. We are all over the country.

So yeah, there's quite a few of us. But I will say I keep in-game voice chat turned off--mainly because we always play together and I've gotten tired of the crap I hear. And I generally keep enemy text chat off, too.
have you ever seen harbor in pro play? he was absolutely oppressive on pearl, bind, and ice box, as seen in the 2023 year from LOUD. plenty of their game plans relied on the regeneration of the high tide for map denial and retaking. they also heavily used the cascade to section off areas of the map for a speedy retake. he’s definitely a bit weak as a solo queue agent, but tweaking him too much would make him miserable in high elo/pro play.
For me it’s animation ≈ skin > finisher > sound > banner

I got scammed I pressed the recruit deadlock button and was hoping to receive a confirmation box which I didn't and 1000 credits got deducted from my account anyway for a refund?
I used to have a problem with skye, she just looks so cute, how can you shoot her
It doesn't matter, I've played on both and it's really the same experience. Just play whatever you prefer
* If they tone down the peeker's advantage just a bit, they can achieve the balance that CSGO had in terms of pure gunfights - holding angles, even common ones, can win you fights if your reaction time and crosshair placement is better than your opponents's provided he is not prefiring. 

* Creating a community workshop for maps and skins. Look up yprac maps in CS - absolutely golden for practicing prefires, learning angles and utility, and even aim training with the aim trainer they created. The community could create 1v1 maps, competitive maps that could potentially make it into the game, practice maps or just fun content. 

* Which leads me to my next point, community servers. Community dm, retakes, executes - these are modes that increase the skill ceiling by virtue of expediting the process of improvement for players. 

* A replay system. A game like this cannot cultivate a higher skill ceiling without this most basic of tools for players. The professional scene would improve, the competitive scene would improve, the average player that wants to get better will have better tools to learn how to better his gameplay more effectively. 

While I understand that all of these things were present in the game's competition, so to speak, I do love both games. Since CS2 released, I have not had the drive to play it because it's current state is actually just several steps back, and servers are available for South Africa now, so I finally get to play this game properly. These above concepts are what I believe to be the best steps forward for the game.
Allright so whats deadzoning?
Noooooo, i neeeeedssss iitttthhh! Lol
They aren't, but I always appreciate riots approach to skins, which is non gacha. It might be expensive but at least they're upfront about it
58 kills is crazy
Maps with three sites are good for Skye. Just having soft recon info is extremely valuable for choosing a site to hit. Add sova in the same team and your never really info starved.
What rank are you?
does anyone know if the misfit toys questline is still able to complete
Hidden MMR is your skill. If you become a better player (win rate, KD, accuracy, econ, whatever else the devs put in their complicated skill formula) it'll increase.
Thanks! :))
No, i am using the default hero appearance. He does talk, but doesnt react to all things like others used to
Honestly I don’t have a farming loadout yet. But I tend to get annoyed when I need to farm for something specific that’s not able to be focused on in resupply (say, batteries or quartz) and people decide to start the mission immediately. Then they give me grief for not being at the objective ready to go and/or not placing traps (how can I place traps if I don’t have enough materials to build them?). Common traps that cause this issue for me are anything that uses twine or quartz. Twine is an issue because I use the Xenon now which requires 30 twine to craft. Tire traps take 2 twine each.

Add to that the fact that people just instantly leave the moment they see an outlander icon… that sure as hell is extra annoying.

“type shi” = similar to [someone/something]

ex: if ur playing sage on bind def and wall hookah and stand on it for an off angle on B long, someone might say “grim type shi” bc it’s the type of wall the content creator grim makes

“sahh” = “what’s up” usually.
U just proved why they do it. U are here venting for something that's not even a big deal. Enemy chat is insignificant and if u take it seriously it will spoil your focus and calmness
It's not esssential......It's just that aim training is more effective if time or progression speed is your concern.

Specialized training routines for specilized activities is a simple and established concept.
And duo-trio Que is not a good experience for knowing what your true rank is.
well, the video tells you to jiggle peek, but do you understand when to and why?

from their perspective, it's probably just crosshair placement and pressing m1 the moment you align.

you can switch up ur jiggle peeks with jumps and such to mess up their crosshair placement. also, since you said you jiggle and get one tapped, i feel as though you try to get info early. as the rounds start, everyone holds the most basic angles already expecting someone to peek. perhaps you should play slower (in the beginning of rounds)

for retakes, you should preemptively aim at the angle you think they will be. aimlabs will get you the raw micro flicks you want for montages and the muscle memory, but it may not teach you the angles you need to be ready to peek. if you tend to ask yourself "where would they be then", just think "where would i be". theyre in the same rank as you, theyll have similar tendencies to you too.

hope this helps you on the rank ladder
Thats the one i unlocked i couldnt bother waiting 😎

honestly it’s so lame how they go out of they’re way to ruin the stw experience in any way they can!

but when it comes to updating or fixing bugs in stw they just turn a blind eye

fortnight is truly all about the money & it shows
fracture is generaly disliked and no idea why pearl got taken out but yea they like to limit their amount of maps so for 2 new ones we got 2 taken away
its really a problem as i can not find them at all anywhere and can not progress unless epic intervenes and do something about it.
yes please!
There is no way to skip weekly missions, they have to be completed. You also need to complete the current set before getting access to the next set. TDM would probably be the fastest way to complete that challenge.
this game had and has so much potential
i dont know why you thought posting a video of you cheating to the reddit was a good idea, have fun getting banned cheater... smhing my head my head

Controller mains act like they marched arm in arm with MLk, when in reality no one is forcing you to play smoke characters in a video game.
If you have game pass you get all the champs basically disproving your point
neon is the hardest duelist to master
the little tv pc lookin icon is usually just people on the other console platform. atleast thats how it is on ps5 games when theres xbox players
Ohh yes, I always love giving my team mates a nice cinematic pan when stepping inside and hearing that glorious slow music
Honestly you’ve played for a month, and in iron there is now way to understand the game yet, it takes time, I say iron through plat is all learning and the same type of players, just continue to control what you can and not Care about what you can’t, 40% are easy wins 40% are definite losses and 20% are 50/50 games be sure to preform in the 50/50 games because those are the rank up difference
if i get one and u don’t i gotchu if u can do the same 🙏
And I dod not play for a few years :)

Why tf u helping the other team traitor
Fair but the marshal has excellent aim scoped or unscoped and does more body and headshot dmg than sheriff with a slightly faster reload and shot. Although I may be biased, the marshal is as good if not better for close range than sheriff.
Nah OP just blinked at the moment
I'm sorry that happened to you. People like this are pathetic and cowardous. Definitely mute them after the first horrible comment they make.

Unfortunately, if you could ban people this way, it would give the same toxic trolls the power to ban everyone else.
yeah yeah, great season, just a reminder he was a chamber abuser, his team was also stacked and very support focused, fns is a genius igl aaaaaand he still lost champions and got kicked from the franchise by cloud losers 9.

far, just fucking faaaaar away from the GOAT status.

Also think there is bug that if you use scroll wheel to switch weapons it will rotate to pistol sometimes instead of your primary gun or just get stuck on your pistol. I've had this happen to me a few time and it is quite infuriating.
Except if you don't look at what you're doing, you won't know what's different from pro players.
just remove all vbucks that you can obtain in stw!

&#x200B;

than only real stw players will stay, and toxic br players will leave \^\^
It’s up now, there’s the 3 I can craft

It may be that you need a better storage system. Once I moved my game from my HDD to my SSD I stopped seeing issues like this altogether
Can’t do it with abilities, but it shouldn’t matter unless you’re just lazy lol. And the zoom thing has a keybind to cycle through all the zoom function in your controls
Hey, what's your Valorant name and tag please? Can look into it for you. Welcome to DM if you'd prefer.
It's extra annoying because I don't know the skin's names by hearts, so I used to drop them to see their names

Now I guess I'll just go fuck myself
if you think clove will be nonexistent in pro play then you are sorely mistaken. they will combo with viper insanely well, and every part of their kit seems like people will be able to get good value from
DMS
Either wait for them to reload or headshot. If you have a vandal and land head shot on first or second bullet the Odin will almost never beat you, it can’t kill as quickly.
Fyi. If you actually want to improve at the gane, you will have to learn to play with phantom/vandal. And the only way to do it is to play with it. Generally, phantom/vandal is objectively better than Guardian, though the guardian also has its strong sides.
The collection book is always there if you don't like the weapons you're currently using...

Bio/location that I want: 

1.volcano area.
2. Old abandoned war battle field.
3. Artic.
4.jungle.

I want player's to go around the earth and fight the storm.
Maybe that's why this map confirms that certain skin lines are canon (Gaia, Oni, Singularity, Reaver and Magepunk) as they're seen in a display on the walls. Agent 8 could've been in the Digihex multiverse?
Characters are like 10x fucking stronger than in-game, obviously for balance reasons.

For example, Phoenix Ult seems to last until he does in cinematics. Neon can shoot a giant fucking shockwave of electricity. Fade is just broken and can 1v4 with Nightmare. Harbor's wall can block bullets like his Cove, it also doesn't break... Yoru's TPs are faster than bullets. And probably a lot more stuff
The Protocol skins will only talk if they're currently equipped, so you'll basically never hear the knife when you have a gun out.
This is not a scientific way to do it, it just proves that you wont get it by filling?


So you where smurfing? To find this out?


But i agree to some extent that its better to play what you are comfortable with, if you are filling then the chance of winning should go up right since it is why you are filling.


As long as it is one of your go to agents?


Simple Logic.


But i respect your dedication for finding this out, but this is not proving anything.


Stay blessed.
You're not understanding my point it sounds like. 

My gripe is that when Iso uses his ult he's locking the enemy in place. Once it is over, if the enemy isn't dead they just go back to where they were standing, right??

So the enemy team can just be waiting for the ult to finish and instantly kill you basically before you move, yes?
No
No, aim training teaches you things like micro adjustments, flicks, and mouse control. It does NOT teach you proper movement, crosshair placement, or game sense. Those 3 things I listed are very important and you’re lacking in those categories from the clips you showed. Understand how to get better at those 3 things from youtube videos and then the aim training will be useful. Right now, you’re just aim training with no purpose. You think raw aim training is all you need, but this is not true.
Play something else for a change. You can come back when you feel up for it or not. Theres way more to life.
Aimlabs is such a meme lol

Not the same game, not the same engine, best they can do is replicate sensitivity settings MAYBE

If you want to aim better in Valorant, you practice on Valorant not aimlabs lmao
But who does that
They’re scared of losing that’s why. They know their team isn’t good enough or they don’t have the confidence to win.
True I get one thrower or afk one my Team pretty much all the time but I can only play in the late evenings rn
Only if he first intentionally deranks the alt account. If 100% of games he's trying his very best then what's the difference with that account and any other? How can you say which account is the main account? What if the alt account becomes higher rank than the main?
maybe with gyro aiming, without, not a chance.
My main account is a little over 5 years old as well, when they first added the challenge I was already 3/4 of the way through it just from normal gameplay, and completed it the rest of the way through normal gameplay. 

I don't overbuild, I try to build as efficiently as possible to conserve mats and typically just build around the objective and build trap tunnels at strategic points. 

Though I do see with the way many play these days that there isn't much room/time for trap tunnels, when they are spamming fields of traps and speed running/run and gunning  the missions. I would expect that kind of playstyle doesn't allow for much progress on the challenge.
This just doesn't explain to me why my last 6 games have been hard team diffs. Matchmaking is completely unfair
I think OP is prefiring.
Not sure why OP's screenshot shows 4-stack but it is a 5-stack comp game.
I don't disagree. I get pissed off when a player gets differently, it's triggering. Just play the damn game. That said... the world isn't going to change. A 15y.o isn't going to change their behaviour, twitch stream are going to make "cOnTEnT", and smurfs are going to play with their friends.
Nothing everything was going fine it was 12-3 and we lost 12-14 :)
100

I wanted that limited edition skin from the valorant games or whatever and figured It would be cheaper to get the biggest package in the long run

I was broke at the time of the first years games so I don't have that year's skin unfortunately
We NEED an honor system in Valorant. 

And one that is even stronger/better then League. 


Honor your team for good comm, shot calling, etc.
And at the end of each act get an original spray or buddy or title.


And then, after each Episode, if you had the minimum required amount of Honor for all 4 acts then you would receive an original skin.
It feels the least like a Valorant map of any map in the game and I can’t tell if that makes me love it or hate it.
Gotta love the stonewood kids that have their vindertech 6 star mechanical parts ahahaha

-sir, its missed the target-
-facepalm-
I don't smurf a lot but I love to see my progress. I started out at Iron 1 took 3 years to reach gold 1 because I barely played lvl 80 account.

So if I go back to iron 3 which seemed impossible for me to climb I get happy that now it's so easy to climb out of it.

However I do handicap myself like playing at 30 fps.
All I really want would be for twine peaks to become a zone similar to survive the horde, except for city, suburbs, grasslands and forests alongside the existing industrial factory. As for the final boss it could still be the MSK, except maybe they add a few new mechanics and a storm king shotgun and sniper. Even if the story is short I just want to see the conclusion to all the characters’ stories
The valorant Australian servers are quite chill and kind. I usually only find one toxic person per 15 games
give him a bj
Please review [our rules](https://reddit.com/r/valorant/wiki/rules) before commenting or posting again. Further offenses will lead to a ban.
I want to point something out to a new player that I feel may also be easily missed as well, but I would go into your games with a goal in mind. Often times, newbies think that aim is everything in tac shooters, and while that is an important factor, I would also look to develop your movement as well and go into games with a learning attitude and focus less on winning. If you're already watching videos about the game, find some routines for deathmatch and the range to focus on crosshair placement, clearing corners, and general "gunfight hygiene" as the community calls it. I remember being stuck in silver for the longest time and felt that I just needed to grind the game more, but this game has more to to learn than it may seem at surface level.

In your spare time, I'd go into the range and work on the feel and mechanics of the game too. There's a setting in I think like Video Settings > Stats > (very bottom) "shooting error graph" that shows you when you're being accurate/inaccurate during shooting due to movement. Play with that for a bit and hit up a DM and try to get headshots with a Vandal. Everyone says to use a Sheriff or Guardian, but I personally found that just learning when to tap/burst/spray as a new player and getting a feel for it was very useful as long as I didn't bullshit myself and acknowledge my own mistakes. Only take a shot when you think it'll be a one tap for the first few sessions, and do not look at your score. After awhile you can find new goals to take into DM for practice, and then real games of unrated/swiftplay/ranked. I think people (myself included, more so at lower ranks) get too caught up in ranks, but if you're looking to improve you should be thinking "OK, so my gap I'm trying to work on today is that I panic before I shoot and I spray, so let me try and relax during every gunfight" or something, and you'll find more measurable results. Eventually you'll get into the more advanced mechanics and nerd shit the game has to offer, but this method gave me actual milestones I could see myself improve upon. Also depending on where you are in your journey, VOD reviews can be useful, and also proper sleeping, diet, and overall physical wellness matter a lot too. Best of luck!
Literally last night I was in agent select for a match and just put it out there I cam fill smokes and some idiot yelled out "SHUT UP YOU TRANNY" Yeah. I'm not playing with someone like that. First time I ever queue dodged. But it's super common. Once was IN a game with all male teammates and they started asking if I made "content" like OF and if i ever would and they got actively mad when I said no...
Most guys aren't bad though.
Bro i had a loosing streak of 14 days and 34 games in mumbai server and i just gave up at that point and after i started playing for fun i started winning
Thanks will do that

I would commit to a single role until you hit Immortal – probably Sentinel.

Your Tracker is pretty clear. You have some work to do on Pearl and Fracture. Watch VODs of professional Sentinel players in ranked and steal steal steal. Steal their util, positioning, spacing, everything. This is infinitely easier to do when you commit to a role and a specific agent on each map.

Finally, you want to develop a really good feeling for lurking AND when not to lurk. Also when to switch sites. You want to make defense feel so easy for your teammates and you want the other team to be so frustrated with you on attack.
as a chamber main, that’s the best way to gut chamber in the next patch; you forgot that the double tp was the exact reason he was so busted. giving him 2 with the same range as now makes him even more op since before (even if the overall distance is shorter), he’s anchored by a short distance. 

why? because he literally could be anywhere on site. it takes away many, if not all, strategies that involve around clearing an op. with one tp anchor, there’s only a few spots he could play and tp out safely without being punished plus u have an idea where he tp to. yes it sucks and less fun but it’s super frustrating as an initiator that have to use all their utility just for chamber to be in a cheeky angle/spot and tp without any consequences. same reason why jett was so good back in the days 

the better solution? add no range to trips. no need for 2 since he’s supposed to be the staller himself or increase the range of his tp until it’s justified 

a cool rework could be his headhunter slowing a single enemy down for a 1-2 seconds but it’s probably never gonna happen

Omen smoke, Yoru Flashes, Cypher trips, Yoru Ult. Perfectly blend of supportive util and self-sufficiency.

Yoru flashes good both supportively and selfishly. Smokes good supportively and synergise with trips on defence. Yoru Ult good for supportive info on attack and useful for outplays in clutches. Flank covered on attack while smokes and flashes are enough to support my team on site hits.
Social anxiety does not help, my friend git called a supermarket nugget

Why does everyone type iso in all caps here do yall just hate him so much you’re always yelling when you talk about him
That’s just happening because of the huge influx of new players that just sit there and get sprayed
THEY THEM
I'm not judging them by the way they use energy cells, I'm judging them for walking into 160s without knowing how to use traps properly
I don’t have an answer but I do have some friends on GA servers who have had the same problem. I also play on GA and my ping has remained the same. Who’s your ISP?
L I have it and it is not getting old at allll
Fuck no, I gotta tell you that I'm very inconsistent, but really, play 2-3 games per day comp, it doesn't really ruin your mental, once your mental starts to broke down or ur tired, stop playing and wait for tomorrow or something. If it makes you better been playing valorant for a year and still at silver 1
A champion Katana would be AMAZING
Which is why I'm saying to bite from other games. They have the system implemented on different games for their version of comp. Just test them out at the very least. I don't really see how this balance you speak of would be affected. The balance is already skewed because you're playing without another body. Making it harder than a fair match. The real imbalance is that the other team gets RR easier and your team has to work harder for the same amount of RR if they win.

Or you could just peek each angle individually and take 1v1 gunfights
My Epic is Lucas-Mikkelsen.
Knows what they’re doing, super chill, gives good calls and easy to work with. And I do sometimes, but they’re over shadowed by the cringey teammates who are incapable of saying anything normal
2/10 in general but 7/10 with friends
If you want to improve by looking at videos of your gameplay don't look at plays where you did well, look at the plays you did poorly in and see what went wrong. It might be easy to assume you got out aimed or snuck up on but generally there is somewhere that you misplayed that you can learn from to improve in the future.
it doesn’t matter dude

they hold a tight angle because they’re on LAN 

some pros don’t have a fast reaction time, idk about in valorant but in CS there was a top level rifler with 250ms reaction time
Marshall should cost more.
Keep crosshair at head level and take 1-2 steps after each burst.

that’s cause valorant is not a battle royale game, nor comparable to one
She doesn't care at all and loves playing with me
Thanks, guess we'll find out.
Controller is definitely the hardest to master as the role has so much potential and impact. You also have very little to use for yourself.
Odin probably gonna be Meta now since there's so much shit to destroy
[deleted]
lol you come play cypher in my games and you will quickly realize that against coordinated teams you will get absolutely run over if you’re not careful
There are gamemodes for that.
I like playing sage cuz I don't wanna clutch alone.
I went from 60hz to 144 recently and the difference is night and day. Everything is much smoother, enemy movements especially are easier to follow because they move a lot more fluidly. It’s not gonna make you a pro player or anything but there’s no downside to getting a better monitor if you can. Games just look and feel better overall which is good enough for me
I think people are more concerned with new play experience than if they can personally keep up
“Successfully”
[removed]
i think that's a game glitch. Try to do the same with different accounts, if it does the same then im sorry But you gotta leave playing brim for a week or two then check again. Problems often solve like this in Valorant.
I have the exact same issue, hopefully someone here has some tips.
yea true, i usually play when im rly tired
is there a definitive best way to get survivors
The only reason you would be obviously bottom fragging is if youre bad
i would also recommend breach. he's not super popular in the pro scene but if you get comfortable with his abilities he can terrorize in ranked, especially coordinated with a duelist to play off of his flashes and stuns

in my games when i see a breach i know it's gonna be a pain because it's really irritating to deal with ppl that play off of him well

You would be surprised how many do. people buy accounts instead of grinding the levels so why wouldn't they buy a skin or 2 from a night market or something if they have disposable income to.
Buddy, you're done. Expect the classicdelayed ban in like a week. 

Mod managers are well known for triggering fortnite anticheat. How did you not know this? Only the mere presence of the process running is enough to get detected. You goofed up man
yeah, I think I did
Bah i'm just gonna believe you on that one, to be fair I don't find this chambers score so odd either but I was reacting on the fact he didn't watch the chat but talked about it.
You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

E - Now has less Hp, recharges after being broke (40s) (last for 30s)

Q - No longer Stuns, Detects if Enemy are within range and tells Deadlock

C - Swaps place with Ultimate Laser shit. Now instead Slows at the Point of impact (old grenade slow and crouchzone)

Ult - Now is a Grenade. Creates an Unpassable Laser Gate for enemies that Last 25 Seconds. Enemies may defuse it by running in (dying in the process but removing the gate.
He’s not a dev, he’s a leaker
This looks incredibly good as a pc player
I end every game with a gg if we win and a gg wp if we lose. Getting mad at someone bantering with gg ez just means you have to work on your mental game. Dropping someone's mental is as much a strategy as macro is, and being able to remain cool in such a situation will do you so much good both in and out of the game!
No because they're all max, you can literally see on the bars at the bottom

I'm shit, however a word of advice is pick random character until you find one you like. When you find one you like, just play that one. You will eventually improve, Comms are always good to use as well.
Is there a Norwegian word pronounced similarly to “rad or four”? Seems like a hint
True
PETER
Don't worry about that enjoy being better people complain usually about 3 things:

1. I'm better but not ranking up (just like you, they are ranking up but they want it faster)
2. Smurfs (enemies are just better)
3. Why are my team mates holding me down (hardstuck people that suck, they were once like you but they ranked up until they became the bad team mate)

Now enjoy your time in 1 because having many kills in a game has a certain pleasure to it, you want the virtual logo on your screen to change as fast as possible I know

But once it changes enough you'll endup in games where you are the bad piece in the team. It's good to progress and grind to improve.

However I'm saying that this time when you are basically smurfing is to enjoy as it builds up your confidence (which is also a skill). The pleasure of carrying every game and gettings kills left and rights will become much more scarce. At high enough ranks (probably around silver 1 given your stats) everyother games you'll be the guy getting picked left and right and accusing people of smurfing.

Basically enjoy the smurfing and try to improve while every game is fun for you.

You'll say that losing and getting MVP isn't fun, compare that to losing and being 9/17. You're having more fun than 99% of the playerbase, enjoy it properly for the rest of us.
Don't compare iron hs% to higher ranks, much harder to get chance for hs in high elo. Low elo any silver can have 40% HS on Iron for example...
Could be, but I've never heard of their names or their team.
Chamber is evil. He is a genocidal narcissist
Countless times someone in my team, or even myself, has asked for a draw because the game has taken much more than planned and they have to go (work, dinner, watever). If it wasnt for that feature I would have lost so many games due to an afk. I think its fine the way it is. Most of the time people dont vote to draw unless its like the fourth overtime
Is it a throw(pressuring teammates so all of us have same roles) and still win? All smokers seems op.
Accidentally clicked on your profile, Jesus Christ all you do is bitch and moan.
i’ve encountered some really nice guys, but it’s always the guys that are qed up together that are the worst. just trying to be funny to impress their friends smh. but they don’t understand that they’re talking to an actual person
i love omen but i think he needs a better ult to be fully complete rn his is one of the worst in the game ( in my opinion ) i think phoenix is the most complete i don't play him a ton but he seems to have the complete package (flashes, wall, self heal, molly)
It’s 80 more a year if you do 336x80. That’s the “pessimist” outlook that doesn’t equate the amount of vbucks you’ll get in an 11 month period from those 90/130 vbuck missions.
first of all hello, it is not possible to reach the radiant rank only by playing valorant. Myself 8 years CS:GO career and constantly going through training. When I started Valorant, I reached the radiant rank in my 6th month. But as I said there is a lot of training behind, 70% of my radiants you see are csgo players.
It’s wayyyy older than that lmaoo
Sometimes it feels like you really were clutching at straws to even make it to 12-12 or you suddenly got shit on even though you were up 8 rounds. Some people don’t wanna risk the rr loss.
I've heard good things about the glorious model o, the wired version is $45 on Amazon rn

Everyone either named I miss her or hers
Nah, I just have decent mental health and don't use "they started it" as an excuse to be toxic.
I'm not sure if you're trolling me or not. But 800 dpi for me is pretty low. It almost feels too low. But that might be because I'm not playing on a desk and I only move my wrist.
The cyclist
Yeah. I make sure to warm up using the range, DM, a few swiftplays for that long or until I'm comfortable in comp. The moment I queue into a game, I either get good games or deal with smurfs. It's such a struggle in this rank.
I mean buying op 3rd round doesn’t tend to be good outside of organised play cause you rely on teammates too much but if you do go for it then just buy half armour and use the 4 bullets
you can play STW for years and not have done or collected even close to everything, or setup all your hb for endurance, get all different versions of your schematics you want, build a perfect survivor squad...........this list could go on and on and on and on.  Not many AAA games can even say that. The fact is Stw is a great game, and it's the only reason Fortnite exists, they released br as a last-ditch effort to save the game and keep their employees.......and it turned into the best competitive BR on the market with the most viewers, prize money etc. So, no shit they focus on br.........STW is a great game and there's a whole lot more content in it than 99% of games on the market........maybe it's just not your kind of game...........I don't think it needs constant updates and new material because it's a pve game with TONS to do and TONS to collect. The player base is small but it's certainly not shrinking........they will slowly add things new probably but if they did that regularly like they do to BR a new player would be straight up overwhelmed and the player base would probably drop.  Instead, I would bet that it's at its highest player base it's ever been at but, I have no data to back that up I just see 30-45k people playing almost every time I log in and I play at really weird hours because of my work schedule. I get enjoyment out of rebuilding my HB endurance builds tweaking them to try and have them be perfect and clean, that alone I've spent more time than i have playing most other games in the past.
.5s is not a significant enough difference to call her smokes weak. Especially when i can still drop 2-3 more smokes than any other controller throughout the round.
Well said, this is it👍
Not skin, but for some reason the Bee Gun Buddy does wonders
In the post.
What is "tactics"?
So you think run and gun is “compressing the skill ceiling” lol
it's weird because riot do a great job with LoL. They make sure soloQ has its own identity separate from pro play
I remember watching him a year or two ago and his content was nice. Then flash forward like 4-6 months . He is just condescending .
ngl, we are kinda dumb for buying them but that sure as hell wont stop me
Oh no an ugly ass sword again xd
it's hilarious you think i'm lying or trolling....

you're ineptness doesn't warrant it.
isn't that really low? granted I'm s3 but that's half of my sens which is just a bit over the pro median.
Chamber on lotus. He has some crazy good TP and trip spots I abuse every game
[deleted]
Always flanking is probably not a great idea, the point of a flank is that it’s not expected. If you are locking raze you should be going with your team for the most part anyways. Your job as an entry duelist is to make space for your team. Work on double blast packs to fly into site. even if you don’t get a kill, the goal is to pull the people defending site’s crosshairs away from the point of entry to your teammates can get out easier. If I were you id watch some professional player’s vods and compare them to your own. (Jinggg and derke are my favorites to watch for raze) take notes on how they play and compare what they’re doing to what you’re doing. Also I know you’re comfortable on raze but she isn’t a great pick on every map (especially breeze, not great in haven either and I think jett is better suited for ascent)
I do

I smell fish….
The AI can definitely tell you are 5 manning though? And if you are doing it in a 4 man you are trolling the solo player.
damage is very weak for viper. so weak that it’s just a small buff. not really significant in any scenario other than ones where her orb’s decay is involved, which sets up her kit nicely.
Nah BR isn’t hard, it’s a free spinoff of Fortnite made for kids, and for founders to spend their daily farmed VBucks. It’s just that this isn’t impressive/uncommon, probably was a bot lobby, and was posted to the wrong sub chief
Yeah I played with yellow for a long time and while I read somewhere that yellow is supposedly easier to see (in general, not valorant specific), I find that a lot of maps have yellowish colors in them and it feels like enemies blend in a bit more when they’re yellow

He's shadow banned lmao

His comments don't go through cause his karma got negative so fast.

I doubt he even had a preseason account. bro talks about it like a little kid trying to impress his friends at the playground.
wait till your duelist steals the spike i decides not to do his role and lurk mid and loses the spike 
SSD dailies and doing the highest level ventures you can
Hi there ! You should watch YouTube guides. Here are some common valorant words/techniques you can search on  : Pre Aim, crosshair placement (on the head, and not too close to the wall), jiggle peek, crossfire, jump peek/jump spot.
I would say omen but it's picked pretty often so you should be comfortable with around 2, probably learn a passive agent as a secondary.
jokes on them i instalock sage and never heal them unless i can. im not going to be pocketing anyone hahha
I love those artworks where people show a moment where the agents are actually enjoying some free time like everyone else. Happily, most banners/cards are like this one.

Nice work!
Thank you!!
Black list bad players then?
Tell me you don’t have a strong constructor loadout without telling me you don’t have a strong constructor loadout
Didnt work :(
I agree but I went a little over lol I spent about a grand and only regret it because the game has regressed over the years and my money just went to corporate greed. Compare Y1 skins to literally any following year and it's an absolute fkng joke. They had SO much creatitvity at launch I loved it. I do regret spending a G because I got on CSGO where there's an actual market and potential with what you buy, not just pixels that you'll grow tired of in a month.. granted CS2 is mid asf and Val's the better game (or at least newer/refreshing.. relax CS heads.. CS2 is literally the SAME game with puffy smokes now, carry on..)  
  
If you need proof of Riot just being greedy.. The pack our right now if you look it says "Proceeds from ACCESSORIES" of this pack directly go to whatever supporting charity. LOL so ONE pack worth over $70 you guys are gonna donate the money from the GUN BUDDY to a charity. Woooow so thoughtful, they worded it so well to where I bet a lot of people who bought the pack are thinking a lot more than $3 went to proceeds. And the ones who bought skins think they donated when 100% went to Riot. And it's not even new skins, it's a fuckin throwback collection which they all the time now, as well as battle pass tier looking skins for $10 with like one or two actual s tier skins annually. Year 1 the creative team was put to work man.
I have a whopping 9% Headshot overall and I peaked D3. Im not good at aiming but I guess it really comes down to game sense and play style. If you're an aggressive player then yeah you will be bound to have a high headshot percentage in High Elo. Im a very passive support player and I got to Diamond by setting up the fights for my duelists, trading them when they get killed and playing post plant.
Check your quests. He’s the only hero you need to complete a quest for to unlock the team perk.
He never played valorant ig, literally used the ult on site/ off map
True but at least it isn’t as bad as csgo lobbies
Split is actually one of my favorite maps. I love playing mid and flexing points, and split gives me a lot of area to work with. 

That said, I'm a filthy Breach main, so of course I like it.
Difference. Jett diff means one teams jett is better than the other.
nah I get that tbh. I appreciate comms a lot too since I looove good communication within a team. But also, I play off of sound so often that I would've chosen directional sound over comms any time. Still, those are some restrictive choices 😭
Water and dry bread
Isn't this old?

A DAC tends to provide better quality and is also easier to replace and modify, especially since they’re made by companies who specialize in audio, they’re also portable and whatnot. Simply better lmao
For lower end CPU’s I’ve heard that it can help to prevent motion tearing. Some higher end CPU’s don’t have this problem.
Found the sexist
Yeah, reddit is a pretty toxic place. Every single thread I read about CSGO cheating even with proof is absolutely full of deniers. 

There's an ex pro (iirc) that is part of overwatch and several years ago he had proof that almost every public game of cs had something like 1-4 cheaters. Given how many hours you have you are probably familiar with him.

His entire channel was about outing cheaters and tracking all of the reports on accounts he sends to verify when they get banned.
pretty sure OP can just delete it.
Are you having fun playing? Then yes.
If you are playing as a team, implementing constructive coordination and communication, you can find much teamplay value even with 5 duelists. But if all of you are playing your own solo gameplay, team composition doesn't matter at all.
Eh controllers have some exceptions though you could argue wall smokes and dome smokes should be in different categories of character.
Poor you bro so you can't be a one trick instalock phoenix and you have to learn other agents that rely on utility and cooperation? Damn, almost if Val is a team game or something
Doing your own storm shield defenses also increase your powerlevel. You can go into ventures to earn survivor superchargers too.
Hey! Good flair!!!
Yeah I didn’t think about how strong he is economy wise and he does have an edge over almost every other agent because of that. However if you compare the value that brings, which is importing yes, to the value almost every other agent brings with their utility that has many more benefits for the team then only the economy.
You can try SteelSeries GG. It's pretty good at that
what
if people asking you for a skin annoys you, then your weird af
Basically, don't get emotionally invested in what you're doing, since being emotional causes problems. If that's the case, why immerse yourself in anything at all lol
i fucking swear the first day of episode 7 i got an accessories shop refresh that looked just liked the normal shop, aka daily, but then it became weekly for some reason
fair dude
Phantom 🤯
I think I'd quickly get bored of it, and for sure wouldn't pay for it.
I am on the verge of quitting after only playing for 2 months.. im in silver right now and i can tell you.. i have played a month in the last act and a month in this one .. there is no comparison.. im getting hit by smurfs more often this one.. idc about smurfs if its just a game out of 10 .. i will just take the L and move on doesn’t really matter. But what pisses me of its become so much more common.. you cant even hit those people and its seriously demotivating for the receiving end … you aint improving vs a guy who one taps everybody consistently and is just miles ahead of you. Afks? Doesn’t really happen alot and if it happens we just take the L its fine. But its mostly smurfs that are ruining the games.
ITS TIME TO PARTYYY
In no fill yeah. In public games there’s three other people there too who have nothing to do w your personal quest
as a Cypher main, I acknowledge you. I once used my cage as a smoke to avoid gunfire, won myself the round AND the game. Enemy Omen missed almost every shot, even one time when we were 1v1. on the last game winning round I attempted the smoke defuse again, but omen said fuck it and attempted to knife me, but Iso was covering my six to stall time for defuse. In the end I defused the spike in front of Omen's face and won. It was nice that he respected me afterwards after I added him and said to him that I know he can do better in the future.
Maybe an hour and a half or two. Idk
Lol, Riot could tell the player base to bend up and take it up the behind & still have defenders. When is Riot not ripping people who buy digital cosmetics off? Lol, worst BP in the industry along with over priced cosmetics you can’t return or sell.
Conspiracy that was true
I just started playing him as well and I usually go by the ~~cumming~~ spitting sound but never noticed the voicelines.
stop tilt queuing and dont flame ur teammates 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
So, I have few questions regarding MSK because I just unlocked him and I'm preparing a build at the moment.  
1. I did some research and according to some reddit posts Smasher Basher is a subsitute to  Surround Pound. Is this correct?  
2. Unfortunately, I've missed Rex Jonesy a week ago and I don't have him. Is Tricera Ops Ramirez a decent alternative?  
3. What would be the best weapon for destroying crystals except SK's Wrath? In some video someone said something about Xenon Bow but I'm not sure about that choice. Somebody else, in some reddit post, suggested De-Atomizer 9k but I thought it's for DPS phase, not breaking crystals. I could also hope I queue with someone who has Wrath I guess?
Bro raze must have some radiant power as well. No way she's satchels like that and has 0 damage done to her body while falling or flying at Mach 10 speeds
Kk nice
Yeah, you've never tried it if you think like that. The difference is huge. Its not about the ms it's about fluidity. The outdated frame stays on your screen for longer, and lower quality screens have worse ghosting, so you can double or triple that ms, and you will have multiple images on the screen.
Nope. Not just you. Mentioned it months ago too.

There’s a “compete” tab in the gamemode select lobby
grim walls refer to sage not viper lol, basically just insanely creative and odd sage walls.
its made for faster executes, smokes are short but has util to clear small spaces with decay plus the ult

overall needs better team coordination and is fun to play
i think he will still be very decent and in meta even after this nerf
Hell no, just play ranked, realize that you are just destroying irons in unrated, and get placed below silver. I’m sure you’re just here to get compliments smh
Daily cap resets same time as your daily missions update for me in New Zealand it's 12 noon each day
[removed]
Just curious what do you do? Like college or job
i play hardly any initiators at all so i probably cant help you much when it comes to how to get more out of your util, but just from looking at your tracker it looks like generally the same issues i think most decent silver players have

- warm up. dont go into comp without going into the range. if your aim doesnt feel crisp, do an unrated first or a deathmatch until it does. you’re asking to lose and tilt if you go in without being able to hit your shots and the 10 minute warmup game doesnt compare to the 40 minute and -22 rr comp game.

-crosshair placement. i love you, but that headshot percentage is awful and bumping it up will definitely help you climb. the difference between killing someone with your first bullet vs your fourth (with a vandal) and potentially allowing them to hit you 3 times back is huge.

-play to stay alive. dont take risky gunfights, dont take 50/50s, dont be afraid to save in 4v1s or 3v1s. from the start of the round to the end, you just being alive on your team gives the enemy team one more thing to worry about. even if you’re not making any impactful plays, just having the pressure of another player to keep track of is enough sometimes to give your team an advantage.

-as you improve, you’ll be matched against more difficult opponents. the very best way to get out of silver is to play like you’re a plat. i know that sounds dumb but i’ve been there. it’s hard to rely on teammates to do anything in bronze and silver. a lot of people are just barely starting to get a grasp on the gunplay and util mechanics in those ranks. just playing the game until you have better gamesense, positioning, timing, util than most of the people in your rank and the next one up is the best advice i can give.
Tip ranked player and would stay that way if we had the crosshair so SMD dickhead. Anyone who has to talk or act good isn't so get a life 🤡
I was talking about eeeeeverything in the screenshot. not just the wheel. thats my fault

WAIT I DIDNT KNOW THAT LMAOI
Bro I literally just got it in my store tonight holy shit
Really, no recon?
Don't worry about abilities, mainly focus on aim. It'd also be beneficial to pick self-sufficiate Agents like Reyna and Phoenix, but Jett and Chamber are alright at that too. Chamber not as much as he used to but still
Weeklies don't usually carry over into the next episode/act, maybe for the first day you can complete last week's weeklies but by the next day they're usually reset to this act's cycle of weeklies (which start off giving lower XP). Also you're telling me you did 3 sets of weeklies in the span of 2 days? How many hours of Valorant did you log in the last 2 days? Genuinely curious, not trying to be shady or anything
Exactly, why pick her if you can pick Cypher and Killjoy? Just doesn’t make any sense
What does making oolong tea means? I never heard this
Honestly, the hard truth is it’s just a game. If it’s making you unreasonably angry then take a break to breathe and calm down. From your comments, I understand the money aspect. You feel you need to play your moneys worth but imo it’s not worth more than your peace. It just makes you feel miserable when you should be enjoying your time. Also, I instantly mute annoying or toxic teammates. Someone says one wrong thing that I don’t like… mute. Also as a woman I hardly use comms. But I still communicate with my team through chats and pings. I think my course of action for you would be mainly to take a break and revisit a couple weeks or months down the road, use the options set for you like muting if you choose to continue to play rn, and just remember that at the end of the day it’s just a game and it’s never that deep. I hope you start to feel better!!! ☺️
Funny how even tho they're cheating, most people who build that almost fail the mission 😂 I just sit back and watch them scramble all over trying to save it
so this is what my duelists are doing when i’m fighting for my life on site
you should, my BASE also has auto healing btw
I can understand that, but it gets better when you get higher rank.


Still it is frustrating 
Only way to know is to experiment. Gather your grandparents
This list is immediately invalid because you placed DTB on fun.
anyone got referral code for ps5 europe?
but this i can understand. at least theres a thought process of "i want this person's skin, and i dont want to give them nothing. perhaps theyd like a skin trade at least."

dropping a default skin is brainless behaviour
**15. Ceiling gas trap \[Absolutely essential\]**

This is actually my favorite trap, where you'll see me using it all the time in my vids. But I can't rate it too high unfortunately, as it's too conditional, and pretty replaceable. Like, if you take out the gas from the game, you could easily replace it with a drop trap or CEF and your tunnel will still be fine. Safer, even, when you place 'em 2 tiles up. But things like the retractable or the wooden floor spikes, those are even more "irreplaceable" than the gas trap. 

That said, just like the wall spikes, this is the best ceiling trap to be placed over a wall where husks are gonna bash on. CEF's tickle damage ain't it. Drop trap's stalling is good, but the reload is too slow for a single tilespace. The husks are gonna be standing still there, so the constant gas damage adds up, especially with the help of wooden floor spikes or floor freeze below.
A bad smoke is extremely bad as well, the severity of it is that enemy can flood site as easily as soon as u enter site, a bad dart means no enemy scanned and u get obliterated by enemies hiding in site. 

A reyna only has a terrible or a subpar flash. There are so much better agents with superior flashes for instance kayo, breach, phoenix, skye, even gekko sometimes. 

The impact of other agents utils if used correctly has greater impact than just a reyna flash, and sometimes its the combination of these utils that gets u the perfect execute.
It's because racism is so damn normalised while growing up in Singapore. In school people drop racist insults, slurs, stereotypes etc. and nobody really cares.

It only really mellows down when people hit their 20s and even then there are still some remnants of it depending on who grew up mentally and who didn't.

Also. It's not just racism towards Indians. It's racism towards everyone. They could be SG Chinese talking to a Chinese guy from China and they would still find some way to drop racist remarks. It's part of the culture at this point. There's ironically no racial discrimination.
Yeah. Pretty the all purpose weapon. High damage and can clear crowds and do challenges with ease. Perfect for killing everything and utility
I wasn't aware that was a subreddit. Thanks!
I would play but I’m legit silver 2, also this is the stw sub but I saw that you already realized that, only reason I’m silver 2 is cuz I play stw more
5k, how many skins do you have if you don't mind? And do you have a premium skin on each gun or just loads on the ones you mainly use? And whats your favourite skin for the main guns in the game (vandal, phantom, knie etc)? Sorry for the interrogation btw

The Agents. I really love all of them as they are in the canon.

I'd say that I like the lore too, but, since Gekko, now everything is all about those radianite monsters and not about the real problem, Alpha vs. Omega.
You can definitely make money based on the event tier. Obviously, the higher tier ones make you the most, but you are also matched up to against more skilled teams/players. That being said, there are players who regularly get top rankings every act but still cant manage tier 1 level. Networking is also a big factor.
I'd die before round 9.

no preference but i usually queue duo
Haven't actually played Valorant for some time, but I'll be 33 in just over a month. All my friends (who I've been gaming with since college) are early-mid thirties too. EUW.
Please update me if you do the Draw for VP thing.

you're also in the Save the World subreddit, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR, but they don't allow third-party links like Amazon or any other shop site, and the only video/screenshot links they allow are Imgur and Streamable links
Makes sense for remakes, but if you don’t want to play a competitive ranked game, don’t queue ranked.

Your mental is awful, nobody cares what elo you are. If you’re only playing to win and want to leave the second you think you’re going to lose… Honestly just uninstall, you’re a waste of server space.
I have 20k+ hours semi-pro dota and this lesson apply to every game i've played:

- There are unwinnable games with braindead teammates (bad day, u guys cant match playstyle, acc buyer ... ) 

- There are EZ win game with a smurf, everyone gel together with suitable playstyle and counter enemy team playstyle

- There are closed games that ur impact might change the outcome: Did u lose the clutch 1v1 when it was 9-9 or 10-10? Or they eco on 11-9 and u lost then they won the next 3 rounds?

WIN the closed game more and u will rank up. Losing streaks are real, don't let others tell you otherwise, i've seen a pic the guy went MATCH MVP for 8 games straight but all losses.
Valorant is overall pretty chill to new players. In higher ranks where you are expected to know what you're doing that is a completely different story lmfao
Codes expire in 2027. If you really want to get your hands on one somehow, good luck.
what app your using?
Can we stop with all the "best skins" post ? nobody cares about which skin is your favorite, post actual content
Need some info please. If you get agents for free with GamePass Ultimate, would you be able to access those agents if you played the game on a PS5 with the same linked Riot account?
The only real tell is in watching gameplay bc stats are relative to the difficulty of your enemies and also can't give you metrics on intangible things like crosshair placement, game sense, and comms; which are super important. 

I've seen plat 3s with crazy stats (1.3 K/Ds, 85% KAST, and 35%+ HS rates) get absolutely embarassed in mid-Dia lobbies. I'm talking like 3/18 K/D type embarassed. Stats aren't totally meaningless but without context they can be close to meaningless.
i'd rather get rid of breeze
I had a 5 stack to demote to iron lol. Imm to iron would have taken months.
Check out aimlab on steam, you can set preferences specific to valorant. Not sure how different it is from the shooting range but I’m sure there a lot of options you can fuck with
Yes
yep
You can submit fan art to the Valorant support, they’ll give you some VP. When I did this, I got 30VP
Maybe I’m a low level but how to do an expedition I have plankton just unlocked now
He doesn't know
Also it's a good idea to not develop the habit of instantly coughing in gunfights because later in the game enemies can punish you for it

Lmao yea the people that are doing the same thing as you but a little worse are the ones that need to be banned
it? which base? I think by the pictures it’s evident which ones do and don’t defend. hint hint (they rhyme with banney alley and swine cheeks)


Leading me to my next question, why would I need to defend after beating all homebase endurance?
Me everytime after the lobotomy
Crap Community. Thats the simple answer. No Money for Riot!!

Arcane is only piltzaun mybe n the story is early adaptation there more char. Vi gauntlet for melee is cool cuz her is main char
well idk how to prove it, I have a friend that has gotten to immortal in like 20 games (mattan#weeb) and someone that went from gold to immortal in like 150h (aikido#3287), I know a guy that went diamond to radiant in 50 hours (katsuhiro#ari), and a guy that got immortal in his first 50 hours (ixe#3rr0r), and a guy that got relatively high immortal in his first 160 hours (aika fanboy#zefix)

These guys are just normal players, and only ones I know of personally, they're all main accounts. Why would you assume I'm lying? What reason would I have to lie about this lmao
You can see if a comment is edited by an asterisk (*) on Reddit desktop, none of met comments are edited.
I still love my chrinivoid vandal
The goat of complaining about his teammates everytime he dies? True.
I appreciated it.
Yea I still main him
I instalock chamber on Haven and I NEVER use headhunter. Ever. It's so nice not having to waste money on bullets. I'm a decent OPer but can't hit headshots(especially at distance) for shit so I just go ghost and trip. The only times over ever purchased headhunter bullets are when I have 9000 creds and can't buy anyone because we're all maxed out. But I'll never use it.

I'm also booty cheeks with a sheriff in case you were wondering. And the vandal. I'm a body shot demon though with that phantom/spectre/OP
platinum 2 :D
What mode should I play to level up my account to lvl 20 the fastest?
You do realize the Earsplitter can be used with the normal attack, it's not completely useless. The normal attack is quite strong as well. It doesn't hinge in being stuck in place, has the highest base damage hit out of any melee in the game on the 5th swing (vs elemental targets), and doesn't have the 0.86× damage multiplier that the heavy attack does.
When you play the game there will be a map, the generic layout for each map will have site a on one side, a middle part of the map, and site b on the other (occasionally there may be an extra site c). Plus some extra lanes to get to the sites. The main objective besides planting the spike, is taking map control. So if you’re attacking, you need to contest the different areas of the map to be able to make it to site and plant. If you are on defence you need to stop them from entering basically. Once the attackers get to the site, that’s when they can plant the spike. 

The duelist will be the first person that enters the site, because the abilities they have allows them to get onto site easier (one of the most popular duelist is Jett, they can dash/somewhat fly so it’s easier for them compared to just walking on). 

Teams can play any role, you don’t have to have one of each. There’s usually ‘meta’ agents that get picked the most, but no requirement to play them. You also don’t know what agents the other team plays until the game starts
How old are you

Update:   
Chinese lanterns and fireworks pop up when you inspect the skin
tbf in CS the only necessary visual info about people is whether they’re on the enemy team or not, but in valorant the knowledge of if someone’s a certain agent is more important, so adding fancy skins in valorant might conflict with that
sox, as in socks. KJ made KAYO as a mannequin for Omen to knit socks for
Don’t listen to everyone saying you are moving to much, you are supposed to be moving with Jett knives, that’s the point

Imm2 Jett main-but I never took rank serious

To use Jett knives you have to understand the different types of aiming and use them accordingly, 
But before this!
 It is most likely a pc issue/peripherals like monitor hz, if I’m not overclocking my ram, cpu, and gpu jett knives are genuinely actually impossible to use
Moving and shooting seems simple with Jett knives but you need your frame time to be sub 5 milliseconds atleast I would argue. 


I used to practice going into practice mode, and using Jett knives on the bots, I would dash, jump, and headshot 2 bots in the air before I hit the ground, (this is genuinely hard and not even I could do it consistently) 

I would recommend overclocking while in the practice range, to notice the difference in frametime easier
i can go for a high end one what would you recommend
This is also kinda true. I genuinely almost considered not getting skins because I used to see how annoying skin beggars are. Ended up getting them anyway in the end though.
Honestly comp or unrated I think it's important to keep team morality up, if people are having a good time and there's good vibes in your team you're more likely to win than 5 people tilting in silence or flaming each other. If you dont like it its not like there isnt a clutch mute button or general muting

Depends on your current rank and knowledge about the game. I have a fulltime job and a kid and can play around 6 games per week. I've hit immortal several times.
Only watched his movement videos. Which did help me quite a bit. Irrespective of him (not) being a radiant he gave good advice, but seeing he built all this on a lie is just sad and stupid.
I promise you that if you put in enough effort, you will climb eventually (even if it takes a long time). Since this is your first game, one thing you might want to do though is take occasional breaks from valorant and play a single player first person shooter, just to get a grip of using keyboard and mouse in a non pressure environment.
A 1000hz mouse running at 1600dpi will have it's 1000hz as close to fully saturated as possible, allowing for the most consistent and quick latency without compromises. 

So bascially at 1000hz, 1600dpi uses 1000hz fully, other dpis under 1600 dpi, don't.
I didn’t even think to report them because almost our whole team was above them
Congrats dog you beat the game
That doesn't seem real, or is at the very least potent copium
W
That’s 100% irrelevant and does not change a single thing about what I wrote.
I mean that is high ranked. Unlike Reyna though who won’t terrorize 99% of the player base.
\>clicks Sage or Omen

\>waits until 3 seconds are left

\>clicks Yoru, locks it in

... I've had it happen THREE times! (not always with Yoru, but a duelist)
> I mean maybe? But like if he's always acting that way ironically, isn't he just acting that way? 

I see it more as being his coaching persona. I agree it can get annoying at times. But I think he can be funny and engaging and that helps to remember the concepts he teaches.
No. No one else noticed this because every agent has the same hitbox.
I would swap out base M.D. for Base Kyle (Lofty Architecture) and swap Crack Shot for Power Base Knox. This still let's you have a fun loadout and let's you protect the objective.
Don’t get a skin, I think an improvident to his gaming set up would be better. I know it might make it obvious and it could be hard to ask, but if you could get it for us his set up we could make an upgrade recommendation.
I think something small like his favorite agent in a plushie for his gaming table would be awesome.
You can call them like the humans which have power through radianite, for which we have attacks and defence in the game. Basically apart from Kayo and Astra, every agent is either human or radiant. Humans include Deadlock, Yoru, Chamber, Killjoy whereas Radiants include Reyna, Jett, Gekko, etc. I'm not sure about Sage tho.
Ah man , i feel bad . hope you can get gaming pc one day brother . Amen to that .
Fuuuuck I checked Meet The Spy before the other comment, knew it was something TF2 related but couldn’t put my finger on it 😔
yes, i'm very much aware of how to spell propane, the misnomer was intentional.
I expect epic to close the save the world servers within the next quarter, with the situation right now it's bound to happen. I feel it in my bones, although I hope I'm wrong...
Yoru knives > jett knives
I’m at 0.14 800 dpi and it’s great!
Dude, he was an assassin, a hitman; killing Viper was nothing but a paycheck for him. So it is very bold of you to say he was right when the entire assassination-plot wasn't his plan in the first place, simply put, he was a tool. 

Becoming Viper's friend, just to betray her trust and kill her is pretty shitty in my book, to be honest and I would bet Viper kept him alive for the sake of their friendship.
Have you done the math yet? It’s more v bucks because the rewards are better.
None lmfao, I actually find it as a compliment that they have the same taste in skins as me and that’s why they want to play with mine, plus it beats them being halfway through a round seeing it on the ground and bee lining into death for it 😂
Thank you and how would I vod review if idk what the prob is?? Cuz ik some YouTubers do vod reviews but woohoojin I could've sworn it's gold + and idk any others lmao and thanks I deffo need to change something lol, I have my friends help a lil. So thank you :D
Hey man I started like 1-2 weeks ago. Get into it. It’s hard and competitive. If you never play an fps like cs go it will be a challenge. Community is nice, suprisingly lot of female playerbase
Watch some pro play/high level playerd to notice the patterns, where enemies generally push, what are the commonly played angles, the timings etc.

Do you have a good audio setup ? It's not something where buying better gear Wil turn you into a beast, but a bad setup will definitely hold you back.

Make a pause each time you have to peek an angle. Peek only when you're mentally ready to shoot right on the spot, the moment it appears on your screen. If you've never used it, www.humanbenchmark.com is a nice website to train that aspect of FPS games.

Is your movement on part with your aim? You could be losing fights because you get shot before shooting. DM and TDM are good training tools for that aspect, try only shooting an enemy once he shot you at least once. You'll be surprised at how much time you actually have, and how you can play around the enemy's crosshair
Controller long time omen main.
Crosshair code for those who wonder:  
0;s;1;P;c;5;h;0;d;1;f;0;m;1;0t;6;0l;1;0o;1;1b;0;S;c;5;s;2.412;o;0.099

It vaguely reminds me of the UFO sounds from BR a couple of years back.
Great game sense, I personally enjoy the tactical bit of tac shooter more than the shooter bit, besides, if my mechs improve significantly so suddenly then it'll be less fun when playing with friends
Lothar sucks, his hindsight bias is insane and he expects everyone to be perfect no matter if he's playing ranked or playing pro.
Link that tracker
remove the effects and post processing and the shadows, increase the viw limit to maximum and there you go.
WAIT WHY THE HELL NOT, LIKE PHYSICALLY WHY NOT
Yeah that's why I've always believed the strength of the satchels are well balanced. Yes it's incredibly strong when used to its full potential, but it takes a lot of practice, time, and skill to actually use them to their full potential. Not to mention that many of those uses are textbook "High risk-High reward" plays.
Peak ascendant 2 last act unfortunately de ranked to plat3 84rr almost my rank up game but I could not play anymore I think I’m gonna get placed Gold 1 😂
Honestly because of the small interactions I get to have with strangers. There are many negative ones, but every now and then you just meet those people that really stick in your mind for a couple days. Also I’m stuck in silver so I’m really trying to claw my way out lol.

Deathmatch with Guardian helps me out a ton, and the Woohoojin routines as well.
Women who play valorant load into the game looking to play valorant.  If they wanted men to flirt with them, they’d be on a dating app, at a bar, or any number of other activities people engage in specifically to meet new people.  

Hitting on a random teammate is as cringe and unwelcome as catcalling someone walking down the street.  Regardless of your opinions on it, it is harassment.  They aren’t flattered.  You know nothing about this person other than the fact that their voice sounds feminine and because of that you are harassing them.  That is sexism.

Hindu tattoos are not that popular tbh
I think if he wanted a cool one he wud not have gotten that
He has another one

I'm not sure about nonbinary, since it's "2 worlds", seems to kinda miss the point. I'd guess "bigender", or "gender fluid".

But yeah, it's really obvoius they're not cis, with the continuous "they", "their".
just dont comeback

its not worth it everyone just getting cuk by epic

95-98% times we getting bugs and 1-2% times we getting fixes or updates

you have to sit and wait for updates to finish where only br is getting new things

also those muther\*\*\*\* afk leech degenerates have multiplied

not you have 1 guranteed and 50% chance to get 1 more and if you hit a lucky draw then its 3 of them

&#x200B;

you still wanna continue then check r/STWguides it will help you in all area
Riots annual revenue per employee ratio is 600.000 USD per employee. Wage increases in comparison to general inflation have been incredibly low as well. Making a comparison that basic is exactly how it works when such a comparison is correct. 

Please defend your multi billion company further, I'm sure they appreciate it.
I don't understand why people think Riot gives a rat's ass about player opinion. The game is infested with smurfs, super high skin prices, and a radianite point system which is nothing more than a scam. People have complained for years, Riot didn't care, and they still don't.
Some people that are not used to fps do it bcuz they think the crosshair blocks vision "straight ahead"
it is possible, if you just get 1 hs kill and just don’t get anymore kills, but if u actually tried, probably not, i’ve had a game where i dropped 20 kills with 51% hs rate
It's insane man
In diamond most people try to go to the opposite site that I'm playing at. Eventually they will make the mistake and get wiped by my setup and the rest of the rounds they will go elsewhere. It's just the way it is.

I just got my account back after 1 year of emailing back and forth with the support. Got like 50 responses like "we cant verify your identity". I even sent them a video, filming myself with my id card, in front of my monitor recording my gmail account. Nothing. Then all of a sudden yesterday Arthur Stark came out of nowhere and gave my account back. Guy must be the only person working there, you just have to wait for him to show up.
Nah tenz does warmup aimlabs and stuff, I just find it a waste of time. + 500RR is top 1.5k on EU it’s pisslow 🥲
terrible? i wouldnt call it terrible, but rather less useful than xenon because doesnt go through walls, it has the correct arrow hitbox and has it's projectile slowness, in other words it actually requires you to think and use in the correct time rather than just mindlessly pressing over and over again the right trigger to shoot. But expensive? tf you mean with expensive? it uses heavy bullets and has the same crafting materials than the xenon
not radiants xd
Personally, I think Neo Frontier is an excellent Phantom skin.   
+ satisfying kill confirmation sound  
+ nice savvy western themed finisher animation and sfx  
+ cool reload animation and unique sfx  
+ purple and gold color variant to go with Astra's primary colors

Regardless of which you choose though, both skins are pretty nice and satisfying!
Clearly not  invisible enough
Dude... Smurfs = new account created to play in lower ranks. 

If a low account invests in skins (battlepass, etc.), it is less likely that it is an account created to smurf. It's not 100% safe; but still an indicator. My issue is not that the account have skins or not... My problem is a LVL 25 Bronze dropping 40K in my games.

because you’re making an excuse. you know how i know? because i made the same excuse. also if u know insta smoking is normal, why complain about it? getting out of iron is all based on yourself. can u realize you are not good at the game. can you realize your teammates aren’t holding you back. can you realize that all these things you complain about is just confirmation bias? can you realize that your teammates don’t work together because THEY ARE IN IRON
Because Riot learned from other competitive games that this kind of games shouldn't be cross platform. Corssplay is great for everything that is not competitive.
Well Reyna's reason was valid, vandal is better than ares in every way. But being toxic to other people is still a no no

>If your really getting mad over a game grow up dude

I did. I'm offering advice to legit players who want to learn this game mode properly. Because ultimately the game has its flaws but it succeeds in team based pve.

Just saying majority of players who are subbed and actively talk are legit players. So glitches and people promoting their videos usually get bunch up.

I'm pretty sure r/legofortnite would be more helpful
I am friends with the devs at Medal but personally i use outplayed both platforms are great and both teams at these companies are very friendly and close with each other its all friendly competition so id advice to look at both of them since you can also enable or disable all moments in a timeline which allows you to see where exactly you got a kill.

Im not gonna go in depth with all the features since well would be here for a whole week if i did that hahaha.
Solo queue would be amazing.
fuck it lets remove this agent from the game

Blakebeard is a progressive skin. He starts out looking like a pirate, and becomes an undead pirate king as he gets upgraded. You might be seeing the lower or higher version of him.

Buy a frenzy every time lol.

I can click fast and im still shocked at how good that thing is at range too. Close range is even better.

With good aim you rarely need to fast shoot anyways tbh. But sure, a multibind there would be fine. Otoh i personally feel it would be hard to aim+shoot like that, but rapidfire only really comes out in post aim scenarios.

RR is based off of KAST - Kill, Assist, Survive, Trade ratio. And it’s based off of AVG combat score and the rounds won/lost. A team losing 13-0 is going to lose a lot of RR, a team that lost 13-11 is not going to lose a lot of RR. TLDR RR is based off of how you played during your match, everything is considered.
Plat and above is just an ego contest between idiots
Trust me, it’s better to experience it urself when u urself became decent and other players finally have something called game sense then you understand the Breeze experience
Its literally impossible that you are top fragging every game and not climbing OP. Post val tracker or this is just a cope.
domain expansion? what’s that?
Same. I wanted to hit at least immo 3 since I hit  global elite in cs, definitely won't get radiant. But my whole experience with valorant is pain simply do to the gunplay feeling like shit.
So when the console beta is done will the game fully release?

I was wondering, are you still active in vod reviews? I started valorant around a month ago do you mind vod reviewing me?
I personally thought it was great lol
oh ty
It's his night.
Anyone got a extra code
did you read my entire post about placing her sensors deeper so that enemies are more likely to be running? also knowing where enemies are pushing from earlier gives your team more time to reposition
U can’t add support for it unfortunately. Only thing I’ve thought of is somehow making voice chat into text, adding more / better pings and agent voice lines. It’s for the most part not any more information than what’s already there, and it’s still managed by communicating with others, not necessarily giving everyone a third eye.

Ty for ur compliments ^^
fr?
Is that buyable?
You should read more & type less
You have adhd that's why you dont have patience. Collect yourself every round.
Valorant skins are pay to win ???
That’s my point
Recharges though so it's less round losing if you fuck it up. Also it doesn't matter if your kayo knife is 1m off but with an orb that can lose the round
i can assure there is no definitive evidence that really proves mich
Because 70% of valorant EU never went above Gold 3 and they can't admit it is because they don't want to use voice chat (mainly because only germans and brits understand english), while NA players are willing to learn
no pecan
I can’t shoot at all I just wanna look at the shop but I can’t leave training

U gotta aim at the ground...
Just keep playing. 
Level 40 isn't very high, pretty sure I was at level 60 before I went to bronze and I still go back to iron all the time
Yeah, just got my pc after those 9 lives skins and I want them.
omg. no one seems to recognize the floor launchers. why do they keep putting Ceiling Electric fields over my floor launchers.
“If you already have the Agent, however, you won't get any Kingdom Credits at Level 5.”

Alright well screw everyone who has everything
They decided stw isn't that important, probably.
Phoenix, Yoru, Skye, Kayo, Breach can blind your teammates. Also Omen but I don’t know if it counts as a flash
Right, really good aimers... players that already have great mechanics. When building mechanics, it's best to have the consistency. Once you're good, then you have the luxury of changing without it affecting your muscle memory
I don’t play valorant, however there is a trend with some pro players. They have multiple games where they were really good then found one where they went pro. So what I mean that a lot times it’s really just talent. 

Also not sure if diamond is that high to the point where teams scout for potential players
So have i, eventually all your traps will be 144.

I start with damage traps which are all 144 now, so i had to move on to other traps. Currently supercharging the anti-air trap as it's next in line of traps i use most. After that most likely the floor launcher.
“Don't worry, team. If you die, I have your memories backed up at base. Just kidding, just kidding. Or am I?" Always cracks me up (one of the match start KJ VLs)
There's obvious intention of what day one signifies, it's dumb to pretend there isn't. But yes my point is all the time gated content was a means of generating FOMO and some people value collecting those pieces. Titles may be trivial but it's more about Riot crossing the line of double dipping.
It's not just the goofy ahh animation, it's slower than hell too, triple movement baron doesn't even help.
And to think they worked on this a year and thought they did a good thing. lmfao
Can I get coached too 👉👈
You don’t need to “hit flicks” you need accurate micro adjustments. Flicks by their very nature are unreliable.

Flicks look cool when they happen but it isn’t controlled. They have a high degree of luck involved. 1/5 times you’re going to snap flick 45 degrees and  instant headshot me. 4/5 times I’m going to take an extra 100 ms to actually line up an accurate shot and dome you.

And you will fall into the massive noob trap of thinking “man I just need to make my flicks better and repeat them consistently” when you actually need to do the opposite and stop flicking unless it’s a last resort and taking the time to land an accurate shot would 100% ensure your death.
the ones who instalock duelists and cannot play with it. so annoying. they sabotaging whole game and never get bans. riot do smth plss
Dodge the flash
Sad
dw man… i did my last ssd on stone wood and fortnite servers crashed worldwide. and it was the last second of the last wave too. still have the recording and prob gonna post it in here soon
I checked your stats, and a lot of people are saying you should improve your HS%, but I don't think you're that bad (this is only based on stats, I can't tell because there's no VOD involved). Last episode you had 17%, and this act, your rifle of choice (Phantom) was at 20%, which is pretty decent, not everyone can be demon1 w/ 40% HS%. I feel like your impact in rounds can use some work though, I saw that your second played agent was Raze, but your ADR is like 135, DD∆/R is -5 , which is pretty low considering her kit.  Mastering the basics like crosshair placement, movement, strafing, flicking, etc., is very important, since this is still a tac fps game, but util usage is also important (but I'd suggest just locking in Reyna for now). Having a low ADR and DD∆/R on Raze tells me you don't know when and where to throw her kit, which puts your team at a disadvantage since it makes it harder for your teams to find easier kills. Woohoojin's video of iron to gold is really good so check that out
Ooh interesting how The Lab has BR assets, though it's still Chapter 1 at that point I believe.
You didn’t say anywhere after improvement and even silver to ascendant is far fetched. I was iron 1 when I started and am now plat. I get that laptops suck for gaming, but I still can’t believe that a laptop holds someone back that much. Also also you made a new account which is a lot different from going from silver to ascendant as believe me going from iron to plat took a lot longer than playing 5 placements on a new account after I played the game for a while. Long story short I’m willing to bet money that the main reason wasn’t new hardware but probably a placebo of actual skill improvement. I’ve played in silver, and I’ve played with Immos and ascendants, the skill is not comparable.
Harbor is good for double controller on breeze at a higher level imo, but I hate him as a single controller.
You're right carrying is more than just kills. I didn't really want to dig into that nuance though. For the purposes of OPs questions, just simplifying performance to be your K/D seems adequate.

>you could be doing your job perfectly and contributing your best to the team and still lose the game

I'd push back on this a little though. I have definitely seen people who have this mentality where if they "do their job" and lose the round, then it must be their teammates. If you expect to climb, that does mean you need to do something *above and beyond* just fulfilling your expected role. Just dropping your smokes or entrying isn't enough.

So let's say you're solidly 1-1 K/D but have truly giga-brained util and strats. Why isn't that converting into more round wins, which would inevitably mean more match wins and ranking up? If the way you play your role doesn't help you win more games, you don't deserve a higher rank because of it.

Ah, well glad you got clean. Your line of thought was extremely fucking confusing.
This kind of shit makes me angry, just when you thought you finally got away from all the trader's and leeches only to be boxed up in a 160. Unfortunately from testing I've conducted blocking them doesn't prevent you from getting into a mission with them.
You should use sens converter from CS to Valorant. Because edpi calculator it only dependable on one game. Valorant and CS have different scale for Sens there Edpi cant be comparable. (Edpi means = sense inside game × your current dpi that you use on your mouse)
It’s been like that since release (I think) you just need to stand still for way too long so if you’re genuinely away it will happen but the mission will most likely end or you’ll be kicked before you get a chance to see

Ah yes, wanting to play and progress the game is "being impatient".
I went from kj because of a random choice.
Then neon because I thought her ult was good.
Then to raze because I ducked at neon and I now use her as a backup.
Then back to neon for a few days.
And now I settle with kj because I do best with sentinels.
Contact Decay is only 30HP for 1.5 seconds. The impact this has is making Phantom more viable, reducing body shots by 1, and preventing lurking in her smokes. The largest threat of Decay is that combined with Snakebite it's lethal.
All vacuum tube weapons are good, and any weapon that can be rolled to nature are also good. 

My most common used rolls: Crit Damage, Damage, (element), Crit rating, Damage to mist monsters and bosses for vac tube weapons OR damage to afflicted targets if the weapon has affliction damage 6th perk.

Her recall smokes are S tier
It really should be solos can only play with solos and duos but riot arent gonna do that because itll increase queue times. Personally i think they should remove 3 stacks as a whole so theres parity in party sizes across the ranks but theyre not gonna do that either cos people will complain.
Yes crafting options to make lower level traps
Sure, i won't.
I feel like Yoru is more of a fuck boy than Gekko is lol
Wait really? I swear she was allowed in the LCQ leading up to champs, why have different rules after?
So basically she admits this happened, she just doesn't want to ruin her career so she is being apologetic. I feel for her.
I'm pretty sure you can't get to 140pl unless they randomly decided to increase it.
Yeah, i'd say so too, at least.
How long does comp stay down for?

he has some but his buff is far from good for the game, way too easy to get value out of in soloq where no one is really on the same page, coordinated is probably a different story as you'll have reliable teammates but soloq he's a menace
The Finals does. You can buy anything that's been in the store anytime. Then every week you get a couple new things. Free to play and much more fun than fortnite
Anything that re-uses a perk from the old hero system. For example, Smoke Bomb duration perk, Decoy range perk, Diamond Llama etc.

For example, Scourge could work well with a Smoke Bomb duration perk and just use Luna’s voicelines. 

I would also love to see the 2018 Spring It On Questline or the 2019 Love Storm questline return. For the latter, Darkheart Farrah could be a nice hero with the perk "Endurance Training" from the old hero system which increased your maximum energy amount.
You're only going to get replies here saying you're in the wrong sub, because this is the Save the World sub which isn't on Switch. Try u/FortniteSwitch
Yes and reyna allow you to smurf harder
r\\FortniteSavetheWorld isn't official, and r/FORTnITE was made back when STW was announced as just "FortNite" back in 2011

Oh I thought west Jett was Raze for a second.
Never heard of that guy lol
The fact that you only have monophonic sound probably doesn't help. 

With you playing with a single 2$ headphone that is.
Don't sweat it. Just mute. I was told never to play again earlier. I'm level 3. Never have played a game like this before I'm an overwatch player. The game is 24 hours into a closed beta most people are going to suck learning agents and the mechanics. Some people just like to be toxic.
It just makes it cooler and more fun to play with. It's like a car, if there were two exactly the same 1:1 cars (stats wise - i.e. horsepower, 0-60, etc) but one was a mini Cooper and one was a ferrari, I'm taking the ferrari. Also, I just looked up fortnite and chose the first one, I did not see anything about save the world.
Check the players you've "recently played"

You're also in the Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that isn't on Switch, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR
>Idk I feel like there’s a reason pros have a higher pick rate of stinger over spectre?

Yeah and there's a higher pick rate of sheriffs in high elo vs low/mid. It doesn't mean it's better for the vast majority of players. It has it's strengths that good players can exploit better but they are pros for a reason. The stinger has a much stronger recoil and a smaller mag so it's more punishing if you whiff. Same thing with the sheriff doing more damage and able to headshot better, but the punishment is harder if you whiff as you have like 6 bullets and it has bigger recoil vs other pistols.

People are better off buying a spectre unless they really have practiced with a stringer or if they know they're going to fight one person super close range.
In pregame u can put it down, tp and just retake it with no cooldown though cant you?
It’s easier to move in a straight line on console so crosshair placement will be even more important

nothing, you can't sell these skins separately and selling accounts is prohibited/extremely hard to do. I don't think theres much of a market for this.
I have codes if anyone wants any just dm me

Yep.  


I have a couple skins I've scooped on night market sales but I see people with full loadouts for every gun and multiple skins for the same weapon.

More Assist, more first kills, likely more overall damage if your getting a lot of clean up kills.
This is NOT like saying it's above iron and may just be how the commenter speaks. IE my clothes for splashed and I say "it's not dry for sure" you NEED to chill out
Okay but consistently having a negative kd as neon is still a problem. Like, you shouldn't be consistently negative. I agree KD isn't everything, and it's more about value kills than just lurking and getting as many kills as you can, but getting a pick on entry is still super helpful, and if you're not doing that as duelist then you need to switch something up.
DM aim and comp aim are different
he said, "now get the platinum trophy on playstation".

i guess this is the same thing, no?

anyways, congratulations!!
yeah, that's kinda the point.
nah just watch the actual gun reviews, the trailer shows it wierd
Oh you're def right. I've found that most people don't really care (bc most don't even build). But I've def been in a few lobbies where people scream at me in chat for "building the wrong thing"

That's really what made me look into proper trapping. Directional/what traps are best at higher tiers up/reload time/etc. 

So now I know what I'm doing is more or less subjectively correct. If someone gets mad, I just back off from building. But that's usually when someone doesn't know proper setups
just play the game
Had this happen to me with my Logitech G pro. Mine was about 4 years old, after a lot of trouble shooting i figured out that it appeared to be the wireless communication between the mouse and usb receiver was failing. I got one of those usb extension cables and it worked great for another 3 months but is now completely useless. Mine wasn’t as bad as yours, just freezing enough to throw my aim off. I just had to get a new mouse unfortunately
but you can’t shoot a sova dart out of the air 🤔
I have a 170hz monitor and I've always wondered if it would feel noticeable to upgrade to 360hz or if it would be money thrown away.
Bro is your reaction time that bad? 1800 dpi is not that fast or do you just not realize that aim sensitivity only applies to the actual game.. when you're aiming
I read all of your bible crying. Let me tell you the "math" behind the matchmaking. 40% of your games, you will win. Getting carried, against trolls or being against really bad players. 40% of your games, you will lose. Cause the trolls and afks will be on your team. That happens. The other 20%, is up to you. You'll need to carry the whole team in order to win. These are the games that and 13-11 or even go to OT. This is what defines you as a player. 

That's the reason why most players have their winrates between 40-60%.
Mouse buttons are smoke and dash, updraft on c so I can hit it with my thumb.
I'm more afraid of pushing into a viper than a Deadlock or Sage haha
Elden Ring and other soulslike games adjust iframes based on fps so that it's relatively consistent otherwise the games would be damn near impossible if you only had 8 frames on a fast roll at 120 fps (effectively 1/15th of a second of Invincibility.) It would also mean that tanking your fps to 8 would give you invincibility for 1 whole second with the downside of a massive 1.5 second recovery time.
Yeah my observation is from na. It may not equate.
but he isn’t the biggest fraud of them all??? he literally reached high immo on his own on raze which is a character he is bad at. doesn’t matter if he’s reached radiant he still has great game sense and is better than his viewers so he can shit on their low elo take as much as he does. so essentially people are pissed that their cope is being called out and looked for a way to circumvent that by calling out hooj? oh no what a tragedy
Exactly!
Eww.. 

Lol seriously I can't figure it out to have any fun. Just weird OP truth map while being simultaneously ratty.. ahh venting.
I think you don’t realize that smurfs are a big problem. If you’ve ever had an mmr where there are lots of smurfs, you will see a lot of stupid usernames, default valorant banners, full caps usernames, earrape, toxic players, EU players, (insert gun)-only players, etc.

There IS a correlation to how toxic your teammates are based on your mmr.

I can’t say for sure you are experiencing smurfs, but players are definitely more tilted at the end of an act, which is why I try to avoid it if I want to climb. 

Good luck to you.
3 bomb sites...thats it
The value of their utility mostly.  Depending on the map, having double controller or double initiator is more valuable as the utility is highly more beneficial for the entire team vs. the more selfish kits duelists generally have.
People do forget about her Ultimate. I think a lot of them want her because of both her Ultimate and healing.

But it's just stupid, since that's not her role, her role is to watch flank.
Id argue yoru is more of a hard counter for unbreakable trip since yoru clone will hit the trip no matter what level its placed at where skye and fade dog wont hit trips at certain heights
It was just for the means honestly I saw the chance and I took it

I think the only thing on iso shield is the INITIAL time for the first shield (before refresh with a kill orb) should be 5 sec less.
On point
Try and see if someone can carry you to the missions in Twine to get the legendary survivors 
And keep your research up to date :))
this happens all the time now. This mission type is so bugged its wild. you can leave with 9 survivors but sometimes 11 spawn. Sometimes not enough spawn. Sometimes the radio tower survivors dont spawn after building the tower. sometimes if youre lucky in the last 5 minutes extra survivors respawn. Also the medbot Survivors can be pushed around while down sometimes so if you cant summon the medbot thats why.
A.C.
happy cake day
Fine, secret Riot dev agent, DON'T take my money ;)
This is advice I also need to take.
Just play. Your rank corrects itself. You can only be hard stuck if you don't improve you will never be hard stuck because of the game.

There are definelty people in lower ranks than they deserve but with enough games played they will hit the correct rank.
Intimidation. A 50-0 Reyna could be hacking, but a 1-12 Jett with a knife kill is truly skilled
AGREE
yes dm me if its an eu link pls
I think they mostly hide their name to avoid annoying people like me HAHAHA
I would suggest placing at least 1 defender next time (better 2, one on each side) to protect everything and turn subtitles on. I know, it sounds silly, but you can read the subtitles even if you can't hear the defenders saying the are down. Besides, there are not that many husks spawning, so defenders should keep the husks away as long as their weapons don't break.  
Personally, I didn't have that issue. But I had a wild boar that was bugged and staying at the ground the whole time. Maybe it killed any husks that came or whatever.
Good. Breeze is the best map and Pearl is the worst map fight me
watch joedabozo. dude is super fun to watch and is probably the best breach streamer in NA apart from like pros and stuff
You should check out woohoojin or other valorant creators and see how they play and look at where they place their crosshair or what they do in game. Once you have good crosshair placement (aka the head area), you will win a lot of your gunfights. Good gun hygiene and aim will get you into gold or plat above that is when game sense is a must
I mute all and hyper focus on why I'm dying...

Then proceed to do it anyway (I ego peaked the same 20-3 Jett)
Love it!!
My whole philosophy is if it makes you happy then just do it. If you like the knife and have the money go for it man.
OP you may want to clear. Though the friends list in case someone decides to get toxic after losing all those skins.
This isn't classroom.
Sounds like a skill issue. Get better.
Okay, so if you’re stuck and not improving, I think it’s because subconsciously, the game has gotten stale for you. Try a new agent, run a bunch of unrated. Always fixes it for me. I’ve been trying Gekko and Kay/0 more because Harbor and Brim have gotten a tad repetitive for me. Helps your gamesense too to see the game through a different role.
storyline quests are done from here yes.   


You still do have stuff to do though, mainly beating the MSK if you havent been carried to it yet. It sucks that Twine Peaks doesnt have a story but there is still fun to be had!
And sometimes you bruise the smurf's ego by trying to IGL when they just wanna w key down mid every round/not play with the team, and then they throw because they have zero motivation to win a game on an alt account.

>double bounce shock dart lineup

>hits 3 of your teammates
Another Cypher main here. The previous guy is talking bull.
I mean if you play on EU i don't mind dropping you those skins while we play but in general bundles never come back sadly
no mid with double entries makes it a very boring map very quick imo

its built for 5 stacking teams, and even then its SUPER boring on ct. its fun on offense… in a 5 stack. 

solo que it just sucks all around. ct is the same every round, and t is just uncoordinated and abysmal for most ranks of the game

personally i miss pearl the most because its mid is so developed and complex, it allows for more than just defending site with the occasional worrying about flank
Yes, your team will get better when you do.
First game of this act, was team mvp but lost, and lost 30rr and was like fuck me it’s whatever. Then next game lost like bad bad, had two teammates that were 1/10 and I couldn’t hold it together solo that game and lost 27rr. So first two games of this act and am down 57rr so far lol
dont let them know the power of my bucky please 😭

No dash?
Shoot it
They dont know that though since tenz is just naturally gifted and is not very good at explaining why hes so fucking good at the game
Probably also a mix of aim discipline and knowing how to strafe.

Strafing is an incredible strong skillset, and often undervalued, in Valorant. Especially considering how strict movement error is now, being able to quickly halt movement and getting near-1st shot accuracy is insane if you have good/decent aim.
I have the same problem. Low diamond. Warsaw Eu server
i actually gasped a little. haven was omens playground. I will now blame all my losses on the lack of haven.
She is that bad
Sick clips from unrated gameplay. Keep it up
Yeah, the Xenon has a huge projectile hitbox compared to all other bows, makes it very convenient to use.
I’ve never asked for help. I’m trying to point out that it is possible that someone drops a 40 on your team without being a smurf and I wish people quit with their offences.

It’s not my fault that the game was designed in a way that you can lose while getting 40 or so kills.
This is the save the world sub reddit
I've given in to the consensus approach to chromies which is to shoot them with the wrong type of weapon.

Everyone else is doing it, I'd rather join in than feel frustrated that I'm about to finish them off with a fire perked weapon when someone pops a hover turret.

Just leaning into the time and ammo wasting.
Was gonna say, gaming in general has an incel/woman hater problem. Valorant is one of the more tame communities I’ve personally seen in that regard.
Overdose on radianite
One kid gave me some 130 's in plankerton. I gave them away next mission.
Nonono, that’s my current edpi and what I’m assuming my edpi before this whole game session was. This game along with the 1-3 before and after it was me trying to figure that out (the hard way) since I didn’t realize what my settings actually were after everything had reset (and since I wasn’t the one who originally put my settings together)
Ok thankyou
Fortnite is Fortnite stop telling people to split up communities.
On pc
Played with a pick me girl who, as soon as she figured out I was a girl too started antagonizing me and eventually said she would "send a bomb to my house to end me because I was playing like shit" like how am I supposed to play well if my own teammate is threatening me?
Gomd 😭 u better be immo talking like this
Alright my other ideas flopped, so new ideas:

- A Bow. Pretty self explanatory. I’m sure there might be a niche for it.

-  A long range shot gun. For all my friends who can’t aim well, but can point in the general direction of enemies

Sage's ult when she resurrects their team's topfragger 💀
Very very fun! A harder mode where you have to guess the map in addition to the location would be  great too!
Intended. AA's have never been strong enough to kill flying husks. You're better off placing Bundlebuss defenders for that job.
Its a limited Beta. You Need a code in Order to Download and Play.
This is how I play it too. One-way their mid box, play on the right lane, knife someone as they run around the tall box, kill them again normally, then tp on top of the box and kill them again. Ult to the platform outside their pawn on the left lane.
I often have this experience in Hong Kong server .i think just hone my mentality and it will put me in a better condition in tokyo server

I main sage but you’re right. I rarely see a good Sage. So many Sages forget to use any of their utility and when I don’t play sage, I’m always confused because the teammate Sage I get NEVER heal or rez or even attempt to plant the bomb. 

I also find KJ and Gekko extremely annoying cause it’s a lot of players that don’t know how to play. AND yoru because they flash the team and don’t know how to play him.
it really shouldn't be
Listen as a plat controller main I already see all the smoke mistakes from people who instalock brim or omen, so the clove players just might be shitty controllers doing what they do. 
To add to that she is designed to be played more agressivly as she’s not punished for dying as hard. 

Other than that I agree with you for the most part. Leave the guys who’ve activly practiced smoking to play a controller.
Only reply in this thread that isn't cringe reddit shit. This is really concerning.
Elaborate?
I have never seen this screen in my 2 years of playing the game. I’m on IL server for reference.
"Boo hoo☝️🤓"
Never used ninja lynx what her skill?
Yes the fixed it. 😍
I hit plat 2 last act but received a gold buddy for some reason. I didn’t play the last like 20 days of the act though. Could be why
situational but generally no, you'll be smoked off anyway so unless you wanna cut noise and deny info and have a plan in mind don't do it
I deadass had no idea until OP explained what it was
Don't cheat...
Is it still just mnk
Nobody said otherwise. It doesnt change the fact that smurfs are fuckers who ruin the game. They cant win in their current rank and probably got carried to their current rank so they play in lower ranks.
Breeze is just too big. Hard to defend, hard to smoke while attacking, hard to hold after plant. There is always someone halls. Too many entrances to a site. Not many places to hold an angle. Playing in mid feels like your naked, as you can get killed from anywhere, it's too big. 

It is essential to play double smokes, because playing only viper, is kinda disadvantagable. You can't rotate, if the wall has been deployed, as playing without smokes in that map, means death. In defending, if the viper uses the wall and smoke at same time, the time is quite less. So you can't smoke mid and a site at the same time, cus of smokes.

 The only playable sentinel is Cypher, that too at b. In a, his trips just gets broken. Sova's dart are kinda, pointless, cus of the sheer size. Same with fade. Kayo and gekko are somewhat viable, but pretty weak. Raze can't be played here. Reyna just doesn't have the util for team comp, not the best pick. Yoru and Jett are pretty solid options fr. 

It's hard to defend, hard to hold after planting spike and the agent pool just becomes so small. Quite a lot of reasons to hate it.

you could probably make your own estimations based on population, NA has something like 600 million people, asia-pacific has a few billion  


with that in mind your players are easily going to be better than NA, so theres that :)
awful logic, you queue ranked with the intent to play your best with your team and aim to win. if you don’t have fun doing that, good for you, play unrated
It was just a one time thing to have a cool record 
dont pla. On doing it again
I mean that’s cosmetics. I understand that. Rarity. But minecraft accounts contain rarity? Limited editions? How?
You mean the recoil reset timings? Or like the spray pattern.
![gif](giphy|tzHn7A5mohSfe)
is this in response to the coconut AFK method?
I think you're talking about UEFN. indeed, it envisions a bright future. But given that most of FN are BR players, they are more competitive compared to other game modes, so the maps of UEFN are more popular with these competitive maps as well.  Zone war, Pit, Red and blue fill the whole UEFN... Hard to say.
I never knew any of this oh my god I've been playing since like 2018 my teammates prob thought i was throwing😭
My 800 was tomorrow so I’m pretty annoyed that I won’t get that
I've had this happen so many times. I've also been the guy who came and got lucky in zone and just did quests. Sometimes it was because i was in a zone i didnt normally get and other times it was because i was low on resources, but once that timer starts, you can be assured my gun is on the front lines. Too bad I can't say the opposite is true for all helpers. I've had too many missions where I've been verbally attacked for not being where someone else wanted me despite doing work elsewhere. These people are why I keep my mic off and pretend I can't hear most of the time. 

Maybe its just me, but i start missions with the expectation that i am going to build. If people who join build, no complaints. But when the vote comes and the mission starts... get involved.
i cant respond to it, so i dont know what to do
Watched some of ur streams main problems with crosshair placement and you rush your shots. U always want to have ur crosshair around head level of your opponent's when i looked at ur stream ur looking down on the floor most of the time. You also tend to immedietely shoot even though your cross hair isnt on your enemy so take your time with your shots.
Sponsorship and it being good enough. For example: no pro is using a Corsair mouse, cuz they have sensor skip and not true sensors. Lol
And this, ladies and gentlemen, is why I hecking love playing Yoru
Yes I'm not playing extremely much, maybe 5 games per week.
u are crazy
The PS5 was launched like 4 years ago so its time to buy one. 

As a company it’s more expensive to downgrade games for old gen than develop games for new gen.

I‘m so glad they focus on next gen to put all their power into it instead of trying to keep for old gen „alive“.
I'm pretty sure I've read before that the game checks what maps everyone in the game has played to make sure you don't end up playing the same map constantly or something like that.
Glitchpop vandal
Yes. Just like I would say that anyone who is racist or ableist should see a therapist as well. The reason for this senseless hate tends to come from another place and not exacty due to someone else just existing.
Huge waste of time tbh, but hey if its enjoyable then fair game!
Let us use Gold to auto-complete Ventures Quests (like the doo-doo, RNG search & find; i.e.) chandelier, billboard quests).

  
For example, if I can't complete the quest after 5-7 missions & have already unlocked the new Ventures zone then allow us to utilize gold for an auto-complete).
I just realized Ray's dialogue makes this even better

Actually there's a rumor(I think) going around saying that Epic plans on making the jam tracks into lobby tracks
Now if only they could find a way to add gifting (something league has btw), to the game.

Small indie company has limited devs though,
Thank you I will try that
Huh, its not actually as bad as i thought. only £169
As with ANY rule or law the point is to deter and not absolutely prevent. Not nearly as many people would bother with alternate phone numbers to smurf or sustain an alt account to play drunk/high with.
I never thought of it that way thank you
They are on attacking side
I basically speed ran the story missions 3 summers ago or so but I was literally stuck on the mimic mission in Plankerton for a whole fucking month
You and your friends objective in playing the game is different. Just like how you put a lot of effort into your job to perfection to get promotion, someone else just want to coast by and get paid. At the end of the day, it's just a job that pays.

You might roll your eyes at my analogy but this applies to everything and anything under the sun. Imagine if someone like Lebron doesn't take it seriously? We wouldn't have one of the GOATs.

I get your friend but if they invite you to play, they should expect that you aren't at their level and ease up. Either tell them to stop playing with you if they wanna win/be serious or you step up and learn

I like this kind of clip. You should watch dacoit aimer playlist. He compile highlight clips from different players like this kind of ace clip. Good stuff anyways
It's a combination of things, let's say a diamond player has gold level aim but ascendant gamesense, they'll stay diamond, a gold player might have plat aim but silver level gamesense, so they'll stay gold. Imagine you're averaging all your skills into one rank.

It can be any combination, but the key thing that separates them is that average, they have more 'skill points' on average
All I’m reading is “If I’m at a disadvantageous situation I’m happy to give up”. And that’s all good, but people queue the competitive game mode to win, not to just give up.
It’s more of a competitive mindset more than anything.
So do your next teams a favor and just queue unrated :)
I play on pc if that helps.

The code is for The Batman Who Laughs 7A8D4-XAVA4-GYL7Z-3Y2MK
Or creator made islands, there is quests at the bottom that you did not do.
Is says available in creator made islands, just read
Is that a flex?
It's literally so dumb someone was trash talking me and I said something back and got banned from using voice chat
And then some asshole steals half your shit while you're passed out after you got your ass kicked by the slime! Who does that??
The locker changes made Save the World UI worse as well though?
I would love to give my opinion on the game mechanichs but I need a codeeee 🤣. Do you have a spare one by any chance?
I play with 1600dpi with 0.09 in game sensitivity
Were you? Literally everywhere i check it says buy round is 30 seconds and 45 on first round of half

Sources: 

[article one](https://www.videogamer.com/guides/how-long-is-a-valorant-game/)

[article two](https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Spike_Rush) (in the summary section)

[article three](https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Unrated) (in the part where it says rounds)

[also someone complaining about this a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/gasoxs/why_is_the_buy_phase_30_seconds_long/?rdt=61424)

If you were talking about cs2 round timers, idk why you were bc OP was talking about valorant when mentioning the 1m buy round time. In fact the whole POST is talking about pros and cons of VALORANT not cs2.

Not to mention i just googled cs2 buy phase timers, and its 20 seconds long, not 15. You were right about me talking out of my ass, which is why i gave two numbers and just now went to go look for more sources.

And using “who would wait 30 seconds between each round” is not a viable source lil bro
If a raze is nading your util then that definitely sounds like g3/p1 lmao. I’m glad to hear there’s one person around this elo that uses util though !
i play sage in my friend group quite a bit and depends on the map, but for a three site map, sage wall is nice on A or C to slow a hard push and allow time for a couple other teammates to get there. then we have one or two of the others wrap through their spawn to get them from behind. works pretty well! 

also nice to use the wall in similar way as smokes, if they break the wall, there’s a small area they can wall out of to stay more focused on. couple that with a slow orb as they’re trying to pass the wall, works even better!
I always suspected gnomes were secretly responsible for the events in STW. They're very suspicious
I see what you’re trying to say, but deadlocks wall takes a half a second to destroy with just 2 people shooting it down. The scenario you’re describing doesn’t happen as the rest of the teammates wouldn’t have time to rotate all the way over on a fast hit.  Her trips are also MUCH weaker than cyphers. Also it’s not a bad thing for a cypher to never have his site get hit, as it would mean that the enemy is going to hit your teams more stacked site while cypher is able to lurk.
Dude's a massive douche, but if he texted you because he was excitedly sharing with you that he got some cool new skins, replying with "eh it's not that great" isn't a very nice move either.
I was talking about a WITCH Sarah, not the mummy. Explain how a Witch is like a mummy and how a Witch Ninja already exists when there isn't one. Theres a contradiction in your statement.
Delete the game before your mind die..🤯🤯🤯🤯
No it’s to do with it being mini boss season last season and it’s an element season this season. 

In a mini boss season most missions have a mini boss, vbucks can only spawn in a mini boss missions and due to there being more mini bosses there is more vbucks. 

In a element season there is not as many mini boss missions there for there are less vbucks to earn
A few months if you’re dedicated
Clove seemed so interesting in the description but I can’t even use half her abilities in the practice range lol. I’ll keep that in mind. 

Iso seemed so cool using the hand moves and difficult to kill sometimes. 

KJ was mentioned a lot online so thanks for clearing things up. 

The bird was SOOOO annoying because I could never avoid them. Plus the heal was so good so I’m glad she’s viable. 

Yoru did seem hard to use but my god was his ult amazing looking… but yes, he won’t be my first few picks because he seemed hard to me as well 

The first time I went against him I was so confused like what is that thing walking towards me? I would love to play him but he seems challenging to learn. 

I got Reyna for my first agent. Who do you recommend for my next one or next few? 

Also yes, I realize the game is quite toxic sometimes so will do. It’s hard to know when and where to use abilities so I might search videos for that. Thanks for the additional information!
[deleted]
Is there actually a duping method that currently works? Asking for a friend. I searched the YouTube and saw nothing recent that actually worked.

And please vote this down to at least -20.
With KJ you really gotta know when to rotate since her abilities take a lot of time to come back and ppl will shoot your mollies if you leave them without alarm bot/other means of info. Also I think with sentinels like her you shouldn't rotate until plant/when its obvious they will cause they already entered.
Playing more is one way. I like step into my enemies' shoes and try to predict what they are going to do
well no shit, tf is this post
I forgot to add, I play on PS5.
Which is fair- except it's at least accountability. Woohoojin really liked to act like he had a deeper understanding of the game than he really did, and that's the main issue. It's not about the rank, it's about how much extra time some people have invested.
0 and silver 1
Lots of trans women post on there because it gets lots of traffic.
cod players don't give a shit and anybody who has gotten past the equivalent of diamond in CS knows you have to pay for a damn 3rd party matchmaker if you want to play without rampant cheating, has been that way for roughly 10 years
If they really could directly detect them, they would have done it. Mousetrap has to be maintained frequently, they wouldn't do that if they didn't need to.
Yes but im saying 9 outta 10 times intiator should plant and then just run off site because their ults in post plant is more useful unless its brimstone or viper and they have lineups
hotter-than-the-sun take, how are outlander's supposed to farm aside from their pickaxe and the hundreds of other melee weapons?

if u have fun playing unrated and it gives ur life some spice why not... for it would be just a waste of lifetime
my problem is with the rotation in general, not the maps. either make it rotate more often or let us choose which maps we queue in at least in unrated

for me the difference between a session where i have no fun at all playing valorant and a session where i do, is determined by which maps i get and whether i get the same 3 maps all day. for that reason it is a problem for me, and when i see other people complaining about it i get it. there are other things people also complain about that i dont, but that doesnt make it "not a real problem"
luka doncic. there's actually a game where some gm/t500 ow streamers got into a game with him, and luka recognized them before they recognized him (i don't think they knew who he was tbh LMFAO). it's really funny, they start asking him what his hobbies are and he says "i play basketball"

Like others have said, random teammates statistically isn't the reason to lose 12 in a row. 

You are top fragging, but that doesn't translate to you playing well. Let me explain:

Are you getting most of your kills by baiting teammates into peaking something dangerous and getting the trade kills? Are most of your kills from you playing like a rat, or maybe playing anti-lurk? Are you playing retakes slowly trying to kill off stragglers? Are you playing too defensively, giving up a site you are supposed to defend then getting kills when its too late to defuse anyway? Maybe its the opposite and you are playing aggressive and getting a kill or two, but dying, and leaving the other person watching site in a 3v1 and the rest of your team has to retake 3v3? From your screenshots, it looks like you favor Sentinels. Are you using your util selfishly for your own kills instead of slowing down pushes? 

Honestly, its hard to say without replays (Rito plz), or knowing much else. It is possible that the games you popped off your teammates were legitimately holding you back. But its also always a good thing to look at what you might be doing that could be causing it. Are you toxic to your teammate? Maybe something more subtle like you are over-comming or over-coaching, especially when you are dead. Maybe you play one side worse then the other and just got unlucky with side selection. 

I'm not trying to imply that it was your fault. I, personally, have no idea. But these are all things to consider after a significant loss streak. I know I've had similar loss streaks in CSGO, Valorant, LoL, etc. where I'm the top performer multiple games in a row and still lose, and in the moment, feel pretty unlucky with teammates. Then look back and realize that I either had a selfish way of playing that didn't let teammates catch up (in xp, gold, econ, etc), or I played for myself, and if I died, put the team in an awkward position. 

Good luck, and congrats on your forthcoming 12 game winning streak!

Record your gameplay.

Hard to give advice without seeing what's going on.

Could be any number of issues.
I would caution against recommending fade for new players you NEED to know her haunt lineups or they will get shot down every time
Relevant. I probably should just repost every year but I am too lazy:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/o1yff1/attention\_new\_players\_old\_players\_inbetween/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/o1yff1/attention_new_players_old_players_inbetween/)
Maybe your mechanics are not that bad and suffer from weak mental.

I personally under perform a lot under pressure, so I'm way way worse playing competitive thank unrated.

How many duels do you need to lose in a match before you're feeling bad, and can you describe how do you feel and what do you think?

It could be also a PC issue, there are entry level requirements to play competitive games. A PC choking on 60 fps is not enough, a non gaming mouse is not enough, etc etc.
the concept of radianite is baffling to me. imagine paying to watch a movie in a cinema and then also having to pay for seating & for them to turn the projector on lol

thanks, it may be my mindset that i am prioritizing trying to last longer by constantly moving > trying to kill first, if that make sense at all lmao. i just don’t know how to change that mental
we dont even know if he was the problem 😭
some people are so bad for their own rank they have to ruin gold or below matches to feel good about themselves
Yeah just play a smokes agent. Blocking the sightlines of long range fights will improve the viability of a SMG. Omen would be ideal because with flash+TP allowing you to close gaps even further, but Viper, Clove, and Brimstone are also solid choices.
you post in crypto subs
CSGO was on consoles. That shit was the most ass.
Sunset isnt worst breeze is
they won’t listen to you, it’s not an issue of if you like it or not, apparently it’s working for them, since COD started doing the same recently and they kept it in gonna assume it’s because casual players are enjoying it more, anyways, this is a sub for StW, since Fortnite nowadays throws you directly into BR, i’ll redirect you there

r/fortniteBR
Damn
Right but there’s the problem. If they have that mentality then what’s stopping them from making the game drag on? They don’t care. If they are gonna get banned then they might as well make the most of it.
Well it’s definitely sad considering how low iq you gotta be to play like that .
ok good for you having a nice experience. But for me, idk why I'm always getting queued with toxic teams. bad luck
Me when i want karma
Ohh I see thank you
Mf if u want to troll do it in unrated, comp is competitive
Same thing, quickly choosing -going a/b/c with a wheel was very useful to let others know where to go
Apologies, I was more just trying to figure out how and where to get the message to riot games so as to hopefully help get it resolved.  I will contact support now that I know.
Why is it so harrrrd
Bro I’m begging for a ps5 code
That's why comp is kind of a joke really.
I do not want to sell the accout. I just saw that the iris is "expensive" and i wanna know a total
My main is on crack
Why update the story line? It finishes once your done twine and thst takes forever to get to anyways, I'd say the storys fine
Astra. Util wise, maybe not so much, but what makes her difficult is game sense, coordination and comms. That won't be any easier on console
How can it know im better than silver if the person above says you start in silver during placements?
you can have the same name as an agent.
Hell yeah, that very impressive, well played my friend :D
STW, this is as much Fortnite as it gets
I feel like Reyna's flash is a team-based utility since it doesn't blind teammates.
Same here.

there are tricks scamers use to pass though walls and steal your mats, once you drop them to ground :)))
32. One teammate said "Yea your voice sounds like you just came home from the war" that made me laugh my ass off.
Make it like siege where you get 5 maps, can only ban 2 and it randomly picks between the remaining 3. It might not be perfect, but at least it'll let me ban dogwater Breeze every time I see it.
Same here on PC. After update my Fortnite completely fucked
What I got from that is the game knows I'm not good enough to be gold 1 and is trying to push me down, so it gives me less rr. Pain
who tf made that select animation... my goodness. The cgi introduced him as this badass hitman but the select screen is this derpy mobile shooter guy. It’s so uncool
Have you checked:

The monitor’s hardware settings are set to 240, windows has it set as 240, and valorant fps is uncapped and vsync turned off?

And verified the cable you’re using can support high refresh rate/plugged into the right monitor port
Wrong sub ;³
Thanks man

Goodness, what an idea, try to win the game. I never thought of that
Remember to tap tap tap tap. Spray is a nono

Practice vandal

Practice dead zoning
I think they made it so only Founders get vbucks from daily challenges, correct me if I'm wrong tho.  
Vbuck reward missions can daily make you from 0 to 130ish depending on rng; https://stw-planner.com/mission-alerts/v-buck-missions  
The main questline and side missions grant roughly 5k vbucks.
I feel like my opinion will be garbage, but from what I remember in comp your rr loss is dependent on how many rounds you win or lose so if your going to lose rr its best to just try and stay and lose as little as possible, unless you don't really care about the rr.  That being said I agree that when it comes to a remake your should have a similar system to unranked surrender where it takes 2 people to decline the vote which is essentially half the lobby then I guess it is somewhat reasonable but seriously 1 person can waste an hour of your time and lose you rr? that is giving to much power to one person for someone to just hold a match hostage essentially until you leave.
> But he shits on everyone with less than perfect aim. Aim is something that improves over long periods of time not instantly. It’s not helpful advice to only tell people to train their aim unless it’s so bad they have no chance of winning a fight.

Because set plays and strategy start to fall apart when you can't consistently take advantage of the good things you're doing due to aim.  It's better to just practice aim until you bother filling your head with a playbook and such.
do you not know how to play split? its in the name. SPLIT. ofcourse you're not gonna win if you're gonna enter the site blindly.
this is basically just a revert of the entire buff lol. cypher saw low amounts of play literally from his release until the patch you want to revert.
I also play on a laptop... just keep good posture it's not worth getting nerd neck.... I'm going to switch to a desktop and monitor setup soon
Or I’m actually zezima
Some of you actually have zero idea what a aim bot actually is.
For me Yoru. I love the outplays you can make with his TP and clone. I make so many Reyna and Jett instalocks mad and it brings joy to my soul😂😂😂😂
Odin is Sova’s bestfriend in Ascent
One learning point that would help them get better at the game, is trigger discipline. They heard two footsteps and shot immediately at the first person coming out even though they weren’t facing them. They got lucky the 2nd person was deaf otherwise they would’ve died sooner. They both walked in without checking that corner, which is a crucial mistake to take advantage of. It’s a tough play with just a stinger, and it probably would’ve helped to communicate with the other teammate to hold off on the peek until they were both out.
I had no idea water did more damage to brick lol ngl. So if it's metal corrosion do you just use metal anyway?
Holy shit viper got nerfed into the ground lmao
Most of them are free fire, pubg and dummy mobile gamers. They just apply the logic of that game, enter site without checking corners or blinds, and die. They just think they can do everything with a gun but when it happens they don't they get toxic.
" I could give two fucks about what some punk ass kid thinks of me or my gaming skills." then why'd you take the time out of ur day to write a big ahh paragraph about the shit
When I got mine it wasn't locked anymore, wait for a day since hacked accounts are locked for 24hrs, open a new ticket if it's still not unlocked. Make sure to change passwords, email, and enable 2fa
Id buy it from you, even if the code is used up
I work from 9am to 6pm, go to the gym and get back home at approximately 9pm. Have a quick dinner and get on valorant till 12 or 1am. Its possible
Do you have friends that are higher ranked that can help you during play? If you play in higher lobbies, you can usually get better game sense enough to get to silver because the other team actually does things that make sense. Or just comming helps. And others can let you know your mistakes if you’re playing with them. Econ management is a huge one.
yeah viper having a sentinel feel is a problem, this patch didn't change that just made it worse

also that wasn't my argument i didn't say you can't hold fracture, i said you can't hold spots in fracture and still help your team with retakes the same way any other controller can because she now has less one smoke every time.
I'm a child? You're the one not getting anything I'm saying. You can still perform great on heavier mice. That doesn't magically make them better. What does make lighter mice better is the objective facts of physics and evidence shown by professionals. It's like the wooting 60 he. You can do things with it that is literally impossible on other keyboards. That is still an objective fact. Pros who don't switch don't change that fact.
Uhhhhh 32😅? I could try to make something work…😆
zappers and blasters are relatively easy to figure out where they are coming from...

I love the arm things sage does when you have ult and then press X.
BR has seasonal stories. No one cares about them though.
well he shouldn't be playing op, you're right. but he IS PLAYING op.
iam hardstuck bronze 2 fr  ( skill issue i know) ( i have been playing for 6 months)
Well your perspective is different from mine considering the difference and experience in our elos
Sure after youve dodge a bunch already. I don’t have a problem with it.
I’d love more fun modes too, escalation & spike rush are all I really play.
I have it off and still see my bullet tracers, i have to turn on and off every time i join a new match
thank you so much, I relate a lot to not understanding why im so ass lol. It’s going to be fun improving
Once I got to like G2 I shot up to Plat 1 in like 10 games.

Now I'm hard stuck cause my mechanics are straight up ass. But we still grinding
Playing chamber in asc/Immo lobbies and i cant confirm This 😅 maybe he is Not good for pro Play but hes doing fine in ranked.
Dont buy it the weekly quests gives you the most XP.
Still can’t answer? What do ninjas offer to the team?
That's true of all flashes. If anything the Reyna blind is the best one to use since it can't be turned. This forces the Sage to either shoot it and wait for the next bullet or just fully get off the angle.
Thanks, writing down new roast 🤣 I got in my head now something like "If there was a new element discovered and named after you, it would be called Assholium"

No it isn’t the worst map there are contenders like Sunset and you could argue the other ones are bad too. It’s a bigger map and allows more room and I love ratting in the side lanes in smokes and using Odin

You should absolutely play Cypher if you've done some R6 Siege stuff, because his kit is basically R6 Siege in a nutshell; but the most important thing you get from playing him is \*game sense\*. Being able to watch flanks, cover areas, lurk and smoke with Cybercage, and tag enemies means you get a really good idea about how your opponents play, which helps when you want to start picking up other agents as well.
Raze?
It says "pre-order" on Xbox for VP. I dont know why you dont get them on PC but you will definitely get it when you can play Beta or launch of game on console

Thank you!!
Try using better traps and reperk some of your guns and perk up aswell
I genuinely think these clips are not good. The clips I showed just feel like lucky shots. Even when you look at the end of the first clip, I was struggling to kill the last guy.
You are like the counter to the guy I met on the enemy team the other day, he was seriously popping off, to the point a few times I was just "nah this guys absurd, what is even happening". 

Tilt got the better of me, I HAD to check his tracker to confirm my suspicions that he was either smurfing, or cheating. Dude had 2k+ games played on his account, peaked his current rank (Asc1) and had won like 13 out of his past 15 games, with 1 draw and 1 loss.

He was just him
slow
thanks for the rating oh knight and shining armor of the valorant reddit, your rating will surely give me good fortune

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that came out before Battle Royale, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

* Casual Battle Royale - r/FortNiteBR
* Competitive Battle Royale - r/FortniteCompetitive
* Creative - r/FortniteCreative
* Lego - r/LEGOfortnite
* Rocket Racing - r/RocketRacing
* Festival - r/FortniteFestival

“gift me pls” posts aren’t allowed in the other subs either, you’re better off getting a job or asking a relative
It’s possible there’s new hacks out that they haven’t caught fully yet. But over 2 years I’ve only seen that screen 1 time. And tbh never played against someone I thought was cheating.
The non binary thing for bloodhound makes sense since he or she wants to conceal identity but it doesnt really make sense for clove to be non binary like if u just showed someone who doesnt play valorant cloves picture they will immediately tell u that clove is a she . The non binary thing wouldve made more sense if cloves identity was concealed like bloodhound
basically everyone i know plays with less than half your sens, (high diamond/asc)
HAHAHAHA
can u put me in ur will for ur val account
Huh, I feel like that’s kind of stupid…like would that not classify as an unfair advantage?
Personally, I enjoy going duelist. I'm currently diamond-ascendant, and I usually play for fun so I don't think my strats are smart or well thought out but here are my two cents:

  
For attacking: In every single map on attacking side, the most important thing is decisiveness and devotion to the plan. The problem that I see the most are people hesitating to push onto site (I understand since no one wants to die).  However, as the duelist, one must simply understand that it is expected of you to either get kills or get info before you perish in order for my team to win the round. I feel as though to play a duelist well you gotta fail a bunch of times and simply build up "game sense". Game sense in another term would be intuition, which is built through experience of failing multiple times.

Strats I enjoy whilst attacking: CHOOSE SITE AND PUSH DONT STOP (WHOLE TEAM PUSHES) / ROTATE IF 3 ENEMIES OR MORE ARE ON SITE / DYING WITH INFO IS BETTER THAN NOT DOING ANYTHING AT ALL

For defending: HOLD. ALWAYS HOLD YOUR POSITION. Never push the enemies, wait for them to come to you. In an objective sense, the defender always has the advantage. There are many corners on every site, and it is hard for attackers to coordinate (most of the time) to look at every single corner at the same time. Holding your position and simply waiting is the most effective when defending.

A strat I enjoy whilst defending: RETAKES (huge risk, but the team chooses one site to defend and hope that the enemy team comes to that site. If they don't come to the site your team is in, then you will attempt to RETAKE the other site and win. An ALL OR NOTHING sort of strat)

To keep the team in sync I make sure that the team has a positive attitude (hard to determine this when they start out toxic, but I will remain positive throughout the entirety of the game and hope that my vibe rubs off on them). Quite literally in my experience, a negative attitude goes absolutely nowhere. You'd rather have a wholesome and coordinated team and lose, than have a toxic team and win. We are here for a good time, not a bad time.

But again, I just play for fun. Hope you got something out of it :)
There is so much wrong in what you said I don't even know where to start.
This is important.
I really recommend just playing 2 to 3 games a day and treating each game like you're on the VCT stage. Also jist auto-lock duelist and take gunfights. The game is really just about getting kills.
Yeah i got to the conclusion that this sub is getting insane.
I’ve seen people go crazy with the spamming of traps and I don’t understand where they are farming the materials. It’s like 1x out of 50 you can even search items that are normally searchable. I’ve done multiple resupply missions and end up having to use mostly little bushes/shrubs to complete the search anything task. The stuff I do have is from the skeet shooting, encampments, build the radar.

Any other ventures and just playing any of the regular maps I’m 99.9% of the time playing as constructor and doing block offs/trap tunnels. This ventures season I use a soldier load out every mission and just mini gun everything with hopes of at least one random playing as constructor in case there’s a spam wave of smashers. 

Overall it’s nice to have a new map and all but holy crap they gave very little effort in play testing this shit. Trying my hardest to blow through this season fast as possible for the superchargers so I don’t have to deal with it anymore. Im almost to level 34 right now.
Damn really? It looked cool having 3x dmg perks but I should swap them then huh? Should I do crit rating crit damage and dmg or should I do 2x dmg to bosses?
did you just use an ai to make this post? lol
How many people are in CT?
first one is a huge reach, after makes sense though
You can pray to the god of your choice that the match making finds you a game without any smurfs.

Otherwise you can play around them, learn where they go and try to focus on eliminating them before committing to a site.

If your defending on some maps you can 5 stack a site and slow play 5 man retake.
I love how everything is just perfect but then the yellow tape lines on the forehead 😭

Good job!
OOOOOOOOF THE SWAGGG
 Coffee.
In my opinion, progress lies in yourself. If it was not by chance that you got your rank, then you will take it again.
There’s a difference?
Classic in a corner is always fun for me, really depends heavily on your agent tho. i’m usually playing a cipher so i’ll hold a trip with a classic while my team executes
I can carry you in this but it’ll take an hour it’s only 15 waves
And? If it's your main? It's not like one of you deserve to play it more.

I played Jett/sage in beta, reyna until KJ came out then I maimed her until episode 6 when I saw eggster play yoru, switched to yoru went from g3 to d1 in one act. Went to military training, came back a year later now I’m a washed d1 cypher main struggling to get out of gold
Then enemies can partially hear and see where it is heading
Watch a lot of Nats and some Radiants who play viper enough VODS you can find on YouTube.
I got a recent game where I bottom fragged and literally got flamed for not only bottom fragging but also being a girl on top of that with sexist "oh i understand now why you're there".

Mute instantly... but I'm also laughing because I literally only had 3 less kills than our top frag! There was either a cheater, a smurf or just someone doing exceptionally well on the other team. But sure, its your teammates!
I only play unrated, so i always say “it’s just unrated” 
and it always works. if not, i dont really care how dog barks at me
Not alone there - mine seems stuck on 6.X... You in the UK by any chance?

No man, that's exactly why Low Elo feels so hopeless and random. You are meant to put all your effort towards winning rounds, not maintaining good personal statistics. Trading kills is of course an immanent part of the game, but low skilled players are not doing this to gain any kind of winning advantage but only to hunt for easy frags without any follow-up, frequently losing rounds anyway afterwards.
Because he flashes around corner…and his team mates get flashed. 

Then he puts his wall up as he pushes from main…and it burns his team mate. 

He took some damage, so he mollies himself in the corner to restore health…right where his team mate is standing. 

Amazing players will do well with him. Average players will have mediocre results and upset team mates. Bad players will accidentally grief and throw games. 

Unless you’re dedicated to never messing up team mates and basically one trick Phoenix, you might as well just play any other duelist to not have the team harm.
Just be cautious using the word aim, because that is the literal mechanical aspect. This isn’t stuff like gunfight hygiene, which I would say is just as-if not more- important then aim in valorant.(guide for it just to not comment twice: https://youtu.be/fJ5ClU3EzWc?si=bSisJ3XuqNYjvciZ)

I agree with you, and honestly people focus too heavy on tracker.
Get the monitor and if you can get a great deal and have a few bucks left look into the Phillips SHP9500 headphones.
They’ve given an explanation to why they won’t do a single only Q either and that explanation isn’t any less bullshit.

For reference: They’ve said they didn’t want one of the ranked mode become the ultimate measurement of skill while the other being disregarded.
I would love it more when fleetfoot ninja kens perk would be removed from him and instead given to all heros as additional bonus...
I get that you’re frustrated, but the harder competition allows you to improve more. Why would you NOT want to play against or with better players? You learn so much more getting your ass kicked than when you stomp people. I would argue stomping scrubs every game builds too much confidence which can lead to bad habits. You have to lose in games like Valorant in order to get better. Take your losses to these “smurfs” and learn from it instead of just bitching about it. I’m trying to provide objective advice instead of dogging on you, but all you’re doing here is bitching instead of trying to use these situations as opportunities to improve.
Your friends are maybe trying to make you feel better or something, but yes FPS (to a point) matters. The biggest jump is from 60 to 120 or 144... beyond that, there is still a benefit, but you get diminishing returns

50 hours is a lot on a tac fps? This is one of many reasons why the constant claims of Smurfs will never be legit — 50 hours on a game like valorant is legitimately nothing in relativity

- you played seven agents across four roles this act in comp. Stick to two agents of the same role and learn to actually play them well by studying pros playing ranked
- play more consistent, at least one/two comps a day, dont take weeks off and then play 50 matches in a week
- you literally just hit asc this act, your hidden mmr is probably trying to hold you back to see if you can perform at your new rank
Why go into the red having to dedicate 24-hour service for every player or completely rewrite the game engine so all the junk code is cleared out when there's semi-pros already doing it for free?
Probably better to join a Valorant community on discord and make friends that way.

Thank you so much man 😭 ur the only person who hasn’t been condescending I appreciate it
That's because we were in a mini-boss season, where mini-boss alerts become the majority of alert missions. Thus making v-bucks missions more common.
Thanks for an actual lead, but can you provide a specific example? All the commentary I'm finding from this person seems to oppose the idea of engagement based matchmaking. In fact they state that Riot isn't actively trying to [manipulate users isn't addiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/ujtzuq/dda_system/i7mb2rf/), that [losers queue doesn't exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/tvb772/this_problem_is_now_getting_soo_common_dude/i82y14g/?context=3), and that [matchmaking aims to create balanced matches](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/v6pbtx/true_skill_2_is_a_potential_problem/ibjgvnc/?context=3). They even talk about how [patents are far removed from game design](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/ruxrvo/why_is_this_game_so_inconsistent_is_it_the_game/hr3ov47/?context=3) and that it's just conspiracy.

But I'm pretty sure people should look at the map regardless to catch flanks?  
I'd rather be notified of a flanker than not know about it in the first place. When players have to reload, communicate or do anything else, they should get out of open spaces into cover. All it takes is a tiny glance that should only help you as long as you know when to stop advancing toward enemies and get back.
Yes?
Yea the account is in a premier team with 4 other radiants
Yea I did confront him in the last round that he meant they were in B Main but by then it was too late and lost the game
yes but I feel like raze woul still be careful
But why do you have a Bucky Skin? There are 4 Options (probably more):

-You are rich 
-You picked it up
-You lost a bet
-You are a psychos

Usually people get sent down by 4-5 divisions since the highest placement anyone can get is Ascendant 1. This means that when Immortal and Radiant players get sent down to Asc 1 the Asc players would have to get sent down to Dia, Dias to Plat, Plats to gold, etc. The start of an episode has and will always be this hectic and if playing 60-100 games to get back to your original rank is enough to make you lose interest in playing ranked I'd just play unrated. Of course, you could also just play better and climb back in less games.
Yeah, they really are meh. I enjoy a wildcat warcry build and raven during ventures with reduced CD, just for something different. The only shooter I have a slot for is commando, and he's used when I feel like a change of pace.
This is the most common thing that infuriates me. People try to correct me
Why not he is an all rounder. You can block sightlines, flash and molly + you can heal and get your ult every few rounds. Imo he's the best agent for  starting players. I see phoenixs all the time in diamond elo too

Thanks for all the advices!!
Very complete and constructive !
I will play it and practice a lot !!

Thanks so much !!
Maybe have a soloq only ranked. It'll probs increase Q times a tad but at least then there's no stacks to throw off ranks either like having a plat play with low gold
I'll add the esports pov. From what I noticed the shorty is useful for 2 reasons 
1) you can hold a corner close when someone is pushing u that u can't with the awp
2) you can play from inside smokes, another thing the awp isn't very good at 


Tldr: awp is long range and sucks short range. Hence shorty which good short range

Mute & move on. Even at the price of comms. I like to play Valorant to relax, not listen to some douchebag bitch and moan.
try not to play on angles unless you’re really confident you can shoot first and don’t peek angles slow walking/walking diagonally
Im very new but I play lots of viper and 2 and 3rd rounds if I lose I always go small shields and ghost til I get some kills or we win a couple I small buy a lot and big buy later on in hopes enemy team blows their creds
Head too smol eyes too bad
Theres such a a vast amount of factors, but you know that anyway lol.  


pro play isnt bronze
I like the simplicity of it lol
Tru dat.
basically, analyse how you play. is it more aggressive or passive? do you like to take gunfights, or play back and support your team with util? it comes down to preference too. but keep in mind, if your impact on a particular agent isn't as much as it should be, you might have to consider changing (but you dont have to think about that right now).

personally, i main controllers right now because that way i can coordinate with my team during entry, and help in holding sites during defense by smoking entries etc.

take your time, you'll get there. good luck on your rank push! :D
phantom is nice on defense sometimes but i like vandal more cuz its just more consistent overall
thanks!
Hey, I can’t use voice chat - would that still be okay with you or is VC required? If it is, unfortunately I won’t be able to use this but I wish you the best of luck in your coaching.

I believe this is a bug, iirc deadlock’s net does (or at least did) the same.
Call me crazy, but didn't 100% or 50% of that 40 million literally go to the professional teams? So, that seems like a little bit less of corporate greed, but I guess I could be wrong on that.
So far my team has followed my chat coms more than my voice coms.
Aim lab is free
Yes aim assist is cheating. If i understand correctly valorant on consoles will not have aim assist so I don't think that argument is valid.
As a former overwatch player, trust me, this game does not need role queue. Overwatch needed it, this game doesn't.
What I'm hearing is that you probably have a very weak comprehension of how to peek and swing
Yea. "Just do a successful site hit 5 seconds into the round" isnt really the kinda character i want in my ranked game. I mean, play for fun and lock who you want, im just explaining why shes weak rn. Yes shes decent against dive, but if you dive cypher/KJ they *should* destroy you too, and also it sucks to be disadvantaged as the round goes on since stalling util is kinda their job.


And, DL doesnt really help with that fast site hit, really. I mean, shooters gonna shoot, but everyone can do that.
You simply leave him. Lots of us game, have businesses or successful jobs and wives and girlfriends etc.
If you're afraid of instalocking then you're not fully confident. A part of you is scared of instalocking, playing bad, and getting flamed by the entire team. 

Only instalock if you're fully confident in yourself without giving a shit about what others think.

Yes, everyone else is instalocking. Why shouldn't you? Why should you care? Just prove that you can perform well and that's all it matters.

I used to play with a friend who I knew was way better as a duelist than a fill character. I used to play with him back in CSGO and we were in a team that made it to main at the highest in only 2 seasonal attempt. He was a fragger and his aim/awareness was better than most pugs. However, he was just like you. Every time he pugs, he would be the "nice guy" and always fill for the team. Don't get me wrong, he was definitely a team player and 100% a nice guy in RL too. Probably one of the nicest guy I know. But because he was filling all the time, he couldn't play the way he normally plays and kept losing. He was hardstuck immortal 3. I told him to stop giving a fuck and just instalock duelists cause I KNOW he can perform better than others but he kept saying no.

1 year later, he finally gave in, woke up, and realized he really needs to stop giving a fuck about what others think. So every game he started to instalock duelists. That's when he finally hit Radiant back to back. 

Playing with full confidence is the way to win. The only way to have that confidence is to play an agent you're fully confident in.
league took years to get a replay system as well. plus just because it’s a competitive game doesn’t mean it needs a replay system. Apex legends for example is a competitive game that’s been out for over a year and a half longer than val has it doesn’t have a replay system. it’s not a necessity for 80-90% of players so no shit it’s gonna take them a while to make one when it’s not a feature that is very much needed
Post your tracker
Rotates are so damn long and I feel like they're super dangerous. Really easy for lurkers to pick off rotating defenders. 

I don’t hate it, but agree it doesn't feel like a tac fps map. Feels like a halo map
f0rsakeN for me. He’s scary when he gets into the zone (like the time he was playing Raze in Split against Heretics in Madrid).
she does have teamplay but players, at least ones that I have seen with god tier aim usually are always the last ones alive and some how clutch the round, mostly due to ult being able to slide around invis getting into a different angle

whenever I've tried her,  I've never been able to get away or the player just knows where am about to pop out of even though they shouldn't be able to see me since am at a distance that is out of their range of sight

they're a lot of bad reyna players too that just can't do anything.  so you also have that too.

she is really only useful when she gets her ult but she can easily mess that up, considering that if you can't constantly tap heads I just never personally picked her

considering that chamber is also similar in the play style, the only difference is that he has detection

so has better lurking that reyna,  reyna should be setting up for entry but rarely do I have see a reyna player do that.

also chamber can quickly peek for intel

then we have Iso that is very similar to reyna 

but at least with Iso, you can create space entry with the shield that can drastically change getting onto a site

as much as I hate trying to fight reyna's in 1v1 situations.  her blinds  arent that great and isn't great at entry

she only strong when ulting
I’m also new to the game (started playing this season/act) and I have been loving the controller role, it’s a bit overwhelming trying to understand where the enemies are positioned and what will make their souls suffer, but playing viper and omen is tons of fun
I’m straight chilling. Until final exam comes up. But chilling every other time
I am gonna find out soon, I am planning on going to his house so ye
damage is not changed. they probably just changed how decimals are handled. most games don't show decimals to users and usually round off numbers when displaying them, while the actual numeric values still being decimal in-game. What probably happened is in some patch they changed how this rounding happens (floor vs ceil)
looks like my aim and i'm immortal lmfao there is something else holding you back, maybe you get extremely nervous in game so your aim in the range doesn't translate well into matches. 

  
also stop listening to these people who say "aimlabs!!!" or its your reaction time. this aim is much higher than bronze level. there is some other issue, which like i said earlier is probably stress.
so you want Epic to delete a shit ton of assets and years worth of design just because people like ninjas?
Imm 1
I think that’s from rocket league but you posted this in the wrong sub.
Good to know, I didn't think the AA was too bad because I didn't notice it, but I mainly played on PC where most people aren't running and gunning, so the difference in playstyle made me want to ask since it seemed like people running around while shooting on console were just as consistent as my opponents on PC while standing still
No I just saw this on my feed, but nice try. One day you’ll get to gold, im sure.
While the VCT is ongoing, big releases usually coincide with the big tournaments (masters and champs). They like to do show matches before grand finals to show off new stuff. 

Release is usually pretty soon after. Patches and updates, as far as I remember, are always released on Tuesdays.
I would say Reaper only because it’s probably the Vandal I’ve always gravitated back towards after buying another Vandal skin. It’s balanced to me. Like the right kinda sound, the right kinda look that doesn’t get old, and I feel like I shoot better. I say balanced because other skins sometimes may look nicer, they might not sound or feel nicer to shoot. And vice versa, for example the Valiant Hero Vandal is my close second because it shoots and sounds nice, but I’m not a huge fan of the look of the skin itself. But I still use it often. However, if it’s a Vandal I don’t own, I would 100% would probably say that it’s definitely the Kuronami. Everytime I pick it up, I keep it for a while and never trade it out for another one off the floor. Occasionally I will even trade my own skin. I’m not 100% a fan of the look (even though it looks pretty nice), but the animations and shooting/sounds are  incredible. I genuinely feel like I shoot better with it. I want to buy it but everytime I see it in my shop, I already just recently bought another Vandal. So I can never really get to the chance to own it. Like I also recently bought the newest one (Evori Dreamwings) and I’ve loved it so far because it also feels kinda balanced butI swear that I probably see the Kuronami in my shop in the next week or so lol.
I'm 26 yo and played a lot, something like 3 to 5 games a day until February, started a new job last month and now it dropped to maybe 3 to 5 games a week. Sad that I don't have that much time or energy to play anymore, but guess that's part of growing up, right? I knew it wouldn't last forever.

PS: I was at another job before but it was remote and only 6hr a day, so plenty of time to play, now I spend at least 3 hour in transport plus 8 actually working
I have a clip of the same thing happening with an enemy reyna, emptied my entire sheriff clip into her and then she tped and got shot by my team on B
Can I have one. I need to do this too lol.
I tried to do a build the radar mission last night. None of them could be built. Either the entire thing was red or I’d get a couple pieces down and one piece would be red. Noped out real quick.
I hecking love tenz 

also you should be able to find a clip like that in the masters Madrid Mini teaser movies
You’re the one who needs to drop the ego homie. It’s plat, not radiant
6 for sure:
Bind
Breeze
Fracture
Haven
Icebox
Pearl

Torn between Lotus and Sunset
It went into the game this time but crashed again, almost worked tho.
aside from the sound when you dink someone, i dont think there is anything else... unless i just have really bad headphones
Gekko is cracked on Sunset. Throwing Dizzy through the A/B main windows is a great way to set pushes up, there's a bunch of good Mosh lineups, and Wingman is always just nice to have in general.
I totally agree. Without a vod, it's impossible to truly say what the issue is. I'm just saying that currently, the stats don't exactly play to his favor, given the reputation these kinds of duelist mains have ("why am I not ranking up when I'm MVP every game??" and then refusing to blame anyone but their teammates). Also, reading through OP's replies on this post, it doesn't fill me with much confidence about the type of player they are.

I played astra for the first time this week because she seems fun and unique but damn the constant in and out of the ult form is really annoying so I can see why she isn’t
Played much
You need to get radiant on NA before anyone would take you serious
I'm diagnosing you with "the big dumb"
Iron player are tough than immortal
you’re gonna be flying a few feet to the side when you press the button, you’re gonna be readjusting your aim anyways.
I said this in another reply. All they need is a button to end the game based on a serious report. We should be forced to compete with these toxic players when they act out and get penalized for leaving. Give the end game report but serious repercussions if it's trolled. Have people review the player report, and if it was honest, then the reported player is appropriately taken care of. And if the person who pressed it was trying to troll the game, give them a 10 day ban or something. That's just one of many easy fixes. And I know people will say crap about it costs too much money to review it. But they already have people doing that on our reports. And they make so much money, they can afford to hire some people to do the community justice.

Follow Woohoojin guides and videos even he is a fraud he was good fraud his coaching thought me how the play this game without good aim.
yes
Well you're also starting on a brand new account on console. It doesn't quite know where to put anyone yet as the beta is fairly new, also the player pool of the beta was and is still limited to the same player base. As the beta just opened again and the only ones who can play ranked are lvl 10+ the game is just going to give you a lobby regardless of rank(with exceptions), im lvl 27 atm on console (brand new account) and im just hitting diamond/asc lobbies consistently. Im not 100% sure but i think the game also takes other things into account, like first bloods, clutches, how long you stayed alive in each round ect. Just keep playing and improving like you said, you'll climb for sure pretty quicky
My desired skin is there, but I lack money
Oh I did that too at first but then I just logged out of my epic account and pressed to sign in with my PSN network,  then I created a new Epic account for my PSN and now it's connected to the new one
The goal is to not miss your first shot/burst. This specifically takes years to get good at.

I wouldn't teach a new player something like jiggle peeking because this is not viable for them.

If they focus on NOT missing their spray they will improve.

It's about breaking the game down to its BASIC level. Miss and you die.

I feel that you are over complicating this issue.
I appreciate that, and yeah I’m just hoping it sort of balances out after playing some more games, I’m just going to start by muting everyone and just trying to get better, because I’m having a lot of fun
Thankyou !!
best advise i can give is crosshair placement, and think about what you can do and look at the enemy comp and try to get into their heads, like what would a gekko on a push do? maybe molly me or throw his lil bro at u? and then u can already think about how to counter it
A lot of cheaters, a lot more than you can tell. Now, it's a lot more rare compared to CS. At least blatant cheating.

Valorant has hidden cheating. Besides, from smurfes, we're not counting them. What you'll see most commonly is scripts to auto shoot to the color outline of a target or a hardware injected realistic cheat and wall hacks. You can find discord servers with these cheats and 10s of thousands of people asking to buy said cheats that are undetected. 

Here is the sad issue with valorant anti cheat. It doesn't work great currently. I've actually seen cheaters get the cheater detected screen and not get banned for a whole month. They can keep playing game after game, getting the cheater detected screen, but still not banned. 

But to finalize everything, there are a whole lot fewer cheaters compared to CS.
Why would you need double the framerate?
Bro what
Whatever you have fun playing especially if you’re playing casually.
Yeah it’s terrorist activity but there’s zero reference to the word “terrorism” in the game so it’s not the most obvious jump tbf. In CS the announcer dude says those words after every round but someone new to tac shooters may not connect the dots right away.
how did you wrote this 300rr peak ?
The great part is i have tried maining EVERY single agent atleast once so yeah raze, omen, cypher Noted👍

Opposite for me. Feels like the hit reg is at its worst and desync is all time high for the servers i play on NA orgeon and cali. Im already behind the wall and get shot still and damage doesnt say wall bang
Explains a lot, every time I see something off I think I’d be easier to just assume there’s a bug in the game
Atleast someone with brain
Happens when you’re out playing your Mmr
Nah. STW’s UI is great!!
Essentially Riot franchising has turned the entire league into a popularity contest rather than relying on being the best teams in the world.

And the one avenue teams were supposed to have into getting franchising through results has the ability for Riot to just say no anyways,

Kinda messed up and why when people say Project L is gonna make FGC esports better i'm like "I sure hope they keep their hands off events as much as possible"
That sucks then, hopefully you can get the PC unbanned so you can play StW again. That’s gotta be crappy just being stuck with BR
sova
That would be an amazing April fools patch
just wondering, how’d you find this post? it’s been a while since i posted and i can’t imagine it’s been one of the top posts
I agree
None of them are even looking. You have to acknowledge that because if you have really good trigger discipline, even if someone has their gun pointed at you you’re not gonna take the shot until you crosshair is on them.
That does make sense
It actually is not in that kind of way. But I had great fun in the process. So many games with MVP, even aces, 40+ frags... Just so it happens it was very long journey 😂
Well, your initial observation that people are better aimers (on average) than OW or Paladins is correct. Your ability to click heads needs to reach a baseline of competence before you can reliably rank up, sorry to say. It is good you've admitted your aim is bad... but if it helps, your opponents aim is likely bad too, they've just been playing this game a bit longer so they know what to expect from opponents.

Once you reach that aim baseline though, utility *is* incredibly important... and there is a tipping point where teamwork and ability usage are realistically more important. (I say "realistically" because aim demons can wreck face, but most of us aren't tenz)

If you are not willing to work on aim, this sadly might not be the game for you, because it is key. If you want to keep playing, do not aspire to rank up because you're good with util or tripwires, aim and good movement are more important at the stage you're in.
I guess the game wanted to tell you. No no no. No Odin for you. 😅
spy tf2 posture
Watch Wahoojin, I really have started to see improvement after following his advice. Play less games, bananna man suggests only 2 a Day so you can actually be mentally in them instead of autopiloting. Get a consistent mechanics routine that you do every day. Now don't do too much aim practice before your games where you tire yourself out just get a consistent routine.
Remember in Wahoojins coaching visa he's coaching the student not you. Take the advice and think if it applies to yourself, if it does write it down. Avoid overwhelming yourself with too much just have one thing your focusing on in your games, and don't worry yourself with changing your crosshair or sens or, vids that claim to have the ultimate tip just focus on steady improvement.
I get that for casual play, its all about fun, so let the player play how they want. But in comp you should learn to deal with the things the game throws at you. If we ban maps, than why shouldn't we also let players ban agents or weapons?

And banning things isn't the solution. It just tries to dance around the problem without addressing it. Riot gets all sorts of data from people playing the game. But if everyone just bans the new map, because they don't know how to play it, nothing will happen.

I get that fracture is very different and it isn't one of my favorites either. But if you get 12-0 in a half because the map is attacker sided, then why don't you get 12-12 once you switched sides? Your opponents have to deal with the same shit as you do.

On a save you prob shouldn't invest in anything too expensive (spectre, bulldog, areas, etc), I usually just go for a sheriff, stinger, shorty, or marshal, depends on the fights that I think I'll take.
The knife cost is normal for most skins at this point no?

Found out tonight that if iso ults Phoenix while Phoenix is in ult form, and it times out during the ult duel, the ult is cancelled lol
i'll probably be maxed out end of the ventures.... yes
Not quite accurate. It less recoil initially, but recoil compounds after every rapid shot. Use it like a sheriff, and you won't notice a difference, besides a onetap at any range

It depends on what it is. Some stuff you can just go into the character you want said skin for and buy it. I have the same problem with Riot you have with Blizzard, I want to buy something, but I don't want to have to wait 3 months, and then another 6 for both the Ion vandal and Ion spectre.

Best case? Maybe a patch next Tuesday?

Worst case? Couple weeks a after they’re shown off at Masters this week

Did about an hour of aimlabs when I started out (I was bronze). Got bored and just started spam queueing ranked and got better(?). I’m currently ascendant
Ty!
I call him little guy
spamming A D A D isnt counter strafing, timing A D A D isnt the same as spamming A D A D tho
Bro his team is so ass 😭 I'd be pissed if I lost with almost 60 kills
480 edpi, 800 .6, (why is that not an option) its much higher than many people but i don’t have that big of a mousepad and it works for me
Bruh
Basically the same
2° Fundation pickaxe stile work fine for me in this last patch.
From my experience,  i usually

Give teammates a standard van/phan, claim its a skin, ask them to inspect it and play champions music through your mic

Put a an agent spray at crotch height and repeatedly press w and s infront of the agent themselves

Teammates trashtalking you? Meow at them, reply "Nuh uh" to everything they say

Teammate not performing well? Tell the rest of the team that theyre just warming up, then hype them up when they get a kill, call them a smurf etc.

Ask your duelist for a heal

Teammates usually will play along and do a small amount of tomfoolery with me but sometimes they might not be having fun but at least i am
I'm new, placed bronze 1, played like 10 games, 6 had obvious smurfs, stopped queuing ranked.
You mean 1/3rd of your life right? Unless you're planning on falling over at 60, lol
Why would I expend traps and mats to do it in a mission when it can be easily cheesed in a single wargames?
40 here and asc 2 you can do it purely off cross hair placement
Yea theyre just sitting in corners around site after the first two dies
cs is better once you have good trust factor

val is just random garbage that you can found toxic anywhere mix with good ppl
in terms of climbing tho, do you lose a lot because youre not up to their level?
[removed]
this would not slide in CS, just saying
chamber is that one zoomer wojak
But tdm does? They Are literally working on nothing, no replay mode, no new modes. All they do is bad reworks for old maps and new tdm maps. 

If it was an indie company i’d agree with you But surely they could improve The dm to be a little more like in cs.
Ask your team for util. At the very least they should follow you in and take up the space you made. Its also a balance on your end to not entry before your team is ready or when the opportunity is gone.
Post this on r/FortNiteBR please.
So true
if i can do well in league nd overwatch and apex without comms and theyre competitive i wouldnt need comms in valorant too
I've been having such a bad time because of amd drivers.
You play with people who you will probably never meet again in a match.

Just talk, if you encounter people who lack braincells you can always mute them
Yeah, but the person gifting doesn't need to be an ass about it like they're gifting their teammate with their superiority.
They cut him out right after the rickroll
It's max. What's the difference between that and DPI? Isn't that just another DPI adjustment?
So you mute everyone in comp before the game even starts? If that's the case wtf bro. If u understood it wrong then mbmb
Oh man you gave me some fun memories of teamfights in Dota where my screen would literally freeze
Yes please these skins would be so much better if we can have the finishers without going sci-fi
Definitely mumbai. Avoid playing on Mumbai. It is known for its toxicity. Play on singapore. Next you queue in the play screen above the player card there will be 3 bars. Click that and you will be able to choose the server. You might get higher ping though
If a team isn’t pushing site you give them the old “don’t everyone push all at once now”
It's still warm up, but yeah, it's a bit stupid, but it fixes the "issue" of only playing Vs extremely good aimers. And no, I don't do that for that reason. It's stupid
Not ping prob packet loss
Prime opportunity for a big sponsor to start an all women team.
…but if they seen a consistent ip address playing and then proof of him on vacation and then the other ip address playing but I understand it would be hard for them to accept.

In EU, i have same feeling but its more like 2min instead of 1.. Could be that unnamed game starting with C and S went into public beta test?

Don't forget Love Storm with increased pink bee dust.
ah so you wouldn't be ffing at 5? gee that might be the reason I'm silver

And I will say in all my time playing I very rarely see neon’s that shift walk once or do better than 6/20. 

“My job is to bhop into 3 people too far ahead for anyone to trade me. Your job is to trade me or you’re bad.”
That's because the game thinks you're of a higher skill level than your rank. If you win in such a lobby then you will be rewarded much higher RR too because the game is trying to get you out of your rank.
Could I have one please
No mobility to get onto a site, except for the ult. The whole point of duelists attacking is to take space. Worst case, if the duelist dies, the initiator/someone else on the team gets the trade.

The mobility is nice on defense to peel away from gunfights to gather intel on where you think an execute is going to happen.
p1
This entire post is so funny 😂.
So many languages in the world and my boi decided to spit facts
It ain't worth shit man, you shouldn't sell your account
Gotcha, much appreciated!
I'm on PS5 and have being doing this a few times. I don't start the defense I build what I want to build then leave. So far it has been saving.
Yes
what the other guy said


but for me, I think it’s cause zero build emphasizes positioning quite a lot, and understanding game sense is easier than learning intensive building mechanics. you’d be caught dead immediately if you’re rotating late from storm with no cover.

not saying build mode doesn’t need positioning; you just generally can get away with a lot more if you’re good at building.
It's not pay to win
You can't deny how useful good communication is. There are so many rounds I was able to clutch only because my teammates informed me on the remaining enemies position/health.

If you don't want to comm, that's totally fine, but you are putting yourself at a disadvantage.
True
As a controller main, playing anything other than viper on Pearl feels like a sin. I know that Gekko+Harbor is a combo but I feel like a god on the A art push. On attack, the molly lands on the little connector when I bounce it off the wall which pushes them back and gives us an almost free entry to site. After that we break all their util on site and play post plant. defense, I put an orb on a main, wall b long off and play mid. With that she effectively covers almost the whole defense line. The ult on A is pretty OP too. I always match MVP on Pearl with Viper and that too without a single lineup XD (The connector molly is guesswork)
Thing is i stopped playing for a year. Then when i came back i lost all my placement games and got placed in iron 3. Rn im on 10 game loss streak. Nothing about my gameplay is bad. I play with my diamond and asc friends in custom games and as jett i usually top frag.
Mhm, the goalposts will keep moving, eventually progressives will win and then theyll find the next thing to complain about bc theyre children who don’t want to eat their broccoli because it looks different to them and so they think its gross even though it’s good for them
If you need a hand with any missions feel free to hit me up
Wouldn't I be smoking myself and my team in if I smoke the entry points because they have already entered site anyways and we need to retake? I'll defo start smoking spike way more tho, I've noticed that I don't really do that
its really that simple. People who say its just a game and they dont care should just play unrated.

Cypher is underrated for entrying
If you're seriously interested in restarting and buying the game again, do it as soon as you can, because it won't ever be cheaper than it is right now.
right between your hero and support team on the loadout screen's your team perk slot, you just have to progress through the story, and if you ever use the soaring mantis team perk, you've got to play as a ninja, and the soaring mantis actually gives you the ability to quadruple jump
And yet this never happens on days with no vBucks
Well yea I can see where your coming from then if you have a full team that is aware then it’s pretty easy
I've played controller and it's the best role.... when people are actually friendly and listening.  That's pretty rare.  

Most of the time what actually happens is:

1. Teammates don't comm and act completely randomly so you either just throw default smokes and hope your teammates can play off them, or run behind your team and intuit where they are going and wing it.

2. Teammates actually comm, but they treat you as the smoke bitch and just order you around or bitch at you when something goes wrong because everyone has an option about smokes and how to play this game.
How long do you have to stand still? One thing that is driving me crazy is when I stop, its like my character has this momentum that carries and it makes my shots inaccurate. Then because I shot and my bullets went all over, I then have to stand still for like 2 seconds for the aim to reset. I don't understand the timing, it feels so inconsistent
Fortnite save the world players try not to wish that another fan favourite game mode gets destroyed. "If I can't have updates, no one can".
oh lol i thought it was some base design they were using, whats up eith the image then im confused
How did it go?
sorry you went through that. you have to be an extra level of sad to shit on ppl in swiftplay
that’s where you are simply incorrect
Wait was this a day or two ago, that happened in my game too 🤣

lmk if it works
Play them all! They're all worthwhile. Just don't ignore objective defense building. Don't just rely on others to build for you all the time. Sometimes a player honestly wants to own the build. Often times they're doing it because no one else is.
Abyss is abysmal. 

Id rather play Breeze and Icebox 24/7 then to ever see Abyss again.

Is this cause by switching your loadouts using the bot?
It’s almost been 5hrs I don’t know when we getting on I just wanted to get a feel for the new agent
Boy you sure are active on this sub. Always so helpful!
But I entirely agree with you.

As woohoojin says himself, there is no definite "one size fits all" solution. A lot of it is always dependent.
Depends on rank but as you get higher initiator is one of the hardest carries by far. So many free kills for you and your team. Can single-handedly carry retakes.
Got another one bud?

You may need to turn on allow anyone to send friend request in your setting for me to see you. Not sure. Either way you should be able to send it to me know, I turned my on.
Passive aggressive? Its only around 5 times in higher PL missions. I don’t know the exact PL changes for how many knocks it takes but when I do v-buck trackers in Stonewood for example it’s usually 1 knock then dead on the next.
Well posting in the right place might be a good start when asking things. This isn't fortnite br.
They fucked that list up lmao

So true.
if theres no problems then spot me a spare 2000 sunbeam rq 🫵🏼😌
PC. But best console for it is probably PS5. It has HDR lighting and load really quickly. Sometimes my gurl will load before me and I have a hella good computer.
Thats the thing, some people dont have a soldier build, but still that only does it for msk, but for average missions, there are 3 predominant loadouts, a minigun loadout, a bow user loadout (i think with stoneheart farah) and those guys that use a guy that dashes and leaves a trail of fire and kills everything in its path. And then we got the people that are obsessed with guns and just have a random hero loadout for damage and thats it, but specifically speaking about lynx, yeah, she is pretty much only usefull for horns and for minibosses, cause you kunai, then one shot from the plasmatic discharger, will normally be enough for any miniboss in msk, although i'm not sure if it needs more shots in 160's zone cause i normally dont do those. But yeah, honestly if you dont want to take fall damage, and be abble to double jump (and your only advantage will be that and that during the kunai your damage is boosted) go for it, but if your not so prone to fall damage, and don't need the double jump. There is a very wide selection of better heroes. OP should check out the youtube channel "Beast" he has a very good and wide explanations of most of the heroes everybody that doesnt have a prefered playstile or loadouts should check it out, because i didn't have my loadouts, nor playstile decided or thought on. So when i found my playstile and decided i needed to make my stuff for the best loadouts, i found his channel. I can be found grinding everyday ventures with the minigun loadout
You make smurfs? 

Good riddance buddy.
I heard Doritos for the first time the other day… tripped me up
Is that really possible?
I always go with the classic “Look buddy it’s not my fault ur dick is small can you stop yapping in my ear so I can focus?”

They usually get mad af so I usually mute them after this and focus on my game. 

The rational decision is to just insta mute if that kinda thing gets to you and focus on your game.
Brain dead lynx: 

• wrath against richochet
• discharger spamming
• all ceiling traps 1 tile up except gas 3 tiles
• aair on tire traps
• broadsides used like wall darts
• material choice always ignores mission modifiers
• using 200 duped traps instead of 1 trap tunnel

Gigachad lynx:

Avoid all these things, just leeching (except picking up the mini boss loot)
Colddd
If you do enough missions you'll level up fast in ventures I made LVL 50 in a week Im LVL 58 now and only jump into ventures if there's a mission for something I want
well Riot won't put me in those games, it keeps putting me thru the ringer

uninstalled just now, my last 10 games were miserable
I'm not complaining agents to be powerful, i just feel repetitive to see them in both teams almost every match. I mean, you have three other duelists (and almost 20 other agents) but they uses two of the five spots of a team. Ever.
I agree, the previous design was perfect. Separating the wraps and lobby sets from the skins seems like an irreversible mistake on their part, or at least hard to fix

I played initiator, sentinel and controller because they are more important roles imo and not a lot of people in this elo know how to play them well enough, but everyone knows how to play duelist. I picked sova, omen/viper and cypher for my agent pool and just switched between them based on the comp. 
Doing this I could create more impact consistently with setups and lineups rather than relying on aim all the time.

I didn’t say they were hella good. All I said was I’m looking for someone that isn’t terrible. I’ve been getting silver 3s nonstop going 3 and 14 and I’m wondering how they even made it to silver. Players that I legit would rather just leave the game so I can get the extra credits and orbs

I imagine if Omen's body has disappeared from the spot by the time the Iso hits the spot Omens body was at, yes Omen would not be caught in the gulag

But any moment prior to Omen disappearing from the spot, I think he would get dragged into the gulag and suppressed while in there

2. Hunt for 1v1s and be as unfair to your opponents as possible.
3. Don't follow mates, don't "solo hold the site against 5ppl because my team randomly rotates" just focus on getting your kills and not dying stupidly.

Yeah but you described that you only instalocked… that doesn’t make teammates turn on their mics magically. Unless you were being an a**hole and trash talking them during the game
Everything in this game is gaudy and overpriced, it's weird to me that so many people are okay with it.
There's a bug were tracking where the drop-down defaults to your current conference but loads the first conference in the drop-down. Switch your conference to another and back again and it'll show you the correct conference with your team.
Yh that's why I bought the Xbox gamepass just for her and tbh it was worth it she's fun as hell

Most people don't know that you can re-cast fade's eye and grab early to deploy them where you want them to land (land spot is indicted by a little green arrow below the projectile)
Are you playing ventures? 

1. If yes: most likely a bug, but did you complete the ventures quests and successfully complete the mission? 

 2. If not: have you completed the beginning of the Stonewood storyline?  Upgrading weapons/heroes/stats is not immediately available, if I remember correctly.
So efffing relatable
You still do tbh. Console Val will be a joke kind of like how Wild Rift is a joke.
Probably not.. i only though so because it will cost 9500 which is basically most expensive bundle you can get. So limited offer makes sence.
Try to find nice people in your lobbies… add them. Play with them.
Yeah when I finished making this agent I had a feeling that he would be op as hell😂 Maybe enemy’s could spot the mirror mirror because they can see an mirror image of themselves in the mirror and are able to destroy it.

If you click on one of your weapon schematics, select “upgrade/inspect” -> “upgrade” -> “modify perks” you can switch up the perks for any of your weapons. The perks can be switched using re-perk and you can upgrade them using perk-up. For most weapons the element is the third perk and that can be switched using fire-up, frost-up, or amp-up (basically elemental re-perk). Re-perk and the three different types of elemental re-perk are easy to get. Green (uncommon), blue (rare), purple (epic), and orange (legendary) perk-up is fairly easy to get but the purple and legendary perk-up just takes a little longer to farm (once you’re in twine it probably takes like 4 hours of playing doing missions that give perk-up as a reward to get enough to godroll one of your weapons). 

The 6th perk on legendary weapons can only be switched using core re-perk which is hard to get. Well, not really hard to get there is just a limited amount that you can get because you only get that from playing ventures each new ventures season and sometimes as the reward for completing the weekly quest that you get once you get into high twine (I think once you complete twine storm shield defense 8 or something you unlock the weekly quest that says complete 10 missions in a 160+ zone. Since all the 160 missions are 4-player missions that require you to defend an objective I usually don’t bother, those 160’s require too much effort and I usually don’t feel like doing that for 3 hours each week). Ya so generally you just want to use the core re-perk you get from ventures sparingly and only on certain weapons like event weapons that come with a fixed 6th perk and stuff like that. For example the spectral blade when you purchase it from the event shop will always have snares enemies as the 6th perk but the “hitting an enemy with this weapon grants +6 crit rating for 5 seconds. Stacks up to 5 times.” is a much better option. 

Btw, all of the founder’s weapons like the nocturno, drumroll, etc all have a fixed 6th perk that cannot be changed. They are all unique 6th perks as well like the nocturno has a 6th perk that each hit marks the target stacking on each hit that explodes dealing a bunch of damage when you reload.

Each weapon has different options for which perks can be in which spot. For most ranged weapons you want to put as many crit perks as possible then for spots you can’t put crit perks magazine size or damage (for full-auto weapons like the siegebreaker I usually go with magazine size, for single shot weapons like the grunt assault rifle I usually go with damage). Most of the base game weapons have the same perk options as the siegebreaker where the fifth perk can either be “dmg to afflicted”, “dmg to snared”, “dmg to mist monsters”, or “dmg to stunned staggered frozen or knocked down enemies”. For all those weapons you usually want to get matching 5th and 6th perks like “causes affliction” as the 6th perk and “damage to afflicted targets” as the 5th perk. For that reason you pretty much always want to get causes affliction as the 6th perk for most weapons with those perk options because otherwise the 5th perk will be pretty much pointless as the “dmg to mist monsters” and “dmg to stunned staggered frozen or knocked down enemies” perk isn’t very good. Yea so for the siegebreaker crit rating, mag size, any element other than physical, crit damage, damage to afflicted, causes affliction are the optimal perks.

Yea the nocturno is really good because you can put 3 crit perks on it plus it has that really good 6th perk. I have mag size, crit rating, energy, 2x crit damage on mine (imo usually mag size is much better than reload speed for most weapons because like for destroy the encampments you can take your time reloading at your own convenience in between waves plus bullet swarm jonesy and crackshot both increase damage with each shot that resets when you reload, with some builds I use chaos agent which automatically reloads your weapon when you use an ability… ya some people put reload speed on the nocturno though because of the 6th perk that triggers on reload).

Normally the best perks for the spectral blade are crit rating, 2x crit damage, energy, attack speed, stacking crit rating 6th perk. However, sometimes people have it perked differently for specific hero loadouts like with paleo luna as commander max attack speed is better, with whiteout fiona as commander and TRO team perk you can put attack speed with 3x crit damage. I would just recommend the normal perks I listed first until you get to high twine and understand all that complicated stuff.

Yea originally pretty much all the weapons had the same perk options, as epic added new guns to the game they wanted the new weapons to be better than the existing weapons in the game that is why weapons like the spectral blade are so much better than most of the other melee weapons. The art deco, spy, and military weapon sets were all added later in the game and you can put some really powerful perk combinations on some of those weapons. Particularly the floor flusher from the art deco set is ne of the best ar’s because you can put 4 crit perks on it plus it has a really good 6th perk “+44% dmg to ___ elemental enemies”. 

O before I said for most weapons that you can put matching 5th and 6th perks on it that is usually the best choice like causes affliction and dmg to afflicted enemies for the siegebreaker. There are a few weapons that break that general guideline. Particularly, the “chain lighting” 6th perk on the vacuum tube sword and the “critical hits causes an explosion” 6th perk on the stormblade are both crazy powerful.
I like asking for a skin trade instead, even if I have the one they have already, just because
I’m surprised they don’t lower the bundle prices while the quality rises as time went by. If you look at older fortnite skins/emotes and compared them to the newer ones, you’d notice that the prices are cheaper for the quality that you get.
Glad to see Viper has been removed from the game.
did you wait for them to fix the bug and respond me? that's patience
It was harder to do because they were huge, did more damage, and could wallbang.
How is it easily countered? Just giving iso a free site by teleporting away before doing anything?


The ults aren't that big of a deal right now because it is 2 rounds max but still a hard counter wich makes it a weird out out of place dynamic for valorant.

A Grey pistol is really rare 
Blue stop sign as well in Stonewood
Having 2 storm chest next to each other is rare
Having 3 Ned's spawning rn to each other is common nor rare.
Having an objective spawn and no visbale pathway for husk to attack is rare


A black Santa hat is currently rare.
Party hats are considered so rare they sell for ($20k) irl

The guns you have are not. Anyone can craft them.
Sry to hear that. It’s definitely something to always fight back on to get a better environment regardless of how often it happens.

It’s also annoying that it happens more so in casual play and the lower ranks, which is where almost everyone starts. So u end up in a situation that’s the worst for u, until u rank up and get better (and that’s not even everyone’s goal. From what I’ve seen, less girls play for competitive reasons and more so for fun than the guys)

But regardless the mute button is still very powerful and practically never hurts to use. I’ve never felt bad about using it. I get the argument of “u shouldn’t have to” or “it’s forcing the victim to stop communicating instead of the perpetrator”. But even so, I still think it’s good and I’m a firm believer that it helps fight the toxicity. It’s way harder to bully and be toxic if ur not getting a response. The feedback fuels it.
Maybe reinstall it play in console and turn people down alot
did u find a solution?
…you can…just go mid? Not everybody always goes into the long sight line parts. In fact I’ve snuck up near their spawn because people don’t tend to watch them.
Bro playing against Tree Roots 2
Yep
60-140 is a huge leap honestly, above that it is still noticable but not as much
I like to get in and play a game once or twice a week. I have since stopped. The games use to be fair and balanced. Now when I hit the play button I fear my game will be ruined. And 9/10 there is a Smurf. I don’t want them on my team. I don’t want them in the enemy team. They make the current game boring and un-fun devoid of actual competition. It’s basically 30-40 minutes of wasted time for all but the Smurf.
There are 3 things that are excluded: 

• Knives over a certain price (I think 4500vp, as someone said) 

• Skins that have come out in the past 2 acts 

• Skins that are exclusive tier 


Yes, the Night Market sucks most of the time but there is no better feeling than getting the skin you want at a cheap price. I’ve gotten Recon Phantom, Reaver Operator, Prime Vandal and a couple other skins from the night market and I couldn’t be happier.
Man you asked if you were trolling and you base your performance on clicking heads of silvers that don't jump spot, use util to clear angles and sometimes even slow walk a common angle.

As a duelist, you must also know what util to ask from your team. You also have to recognize if you're getting separated from your team by mollies when you entry and attempt something different.

If you're at 10 HP, going for a 1v1 is terrible as it's not even a 50-50 gunfight. Instead play at arms length to your buddy.

ttv trickaim FN
the battle royale map is going back to chapter 1 for a mini 1 month long season. all of this has been confirmed through leaks and teasers by epic themselves.
To your first one, yes I do agree it would be really nice to be able to spectate your friend from the friendlist or in the party. And to the secound I don't really agree because it would take ages to find a lobby if you play a popular character since it gotta be a lobby where your team hasn't looked in it. Also some characters are ASS on some maps which would be unlucky if you choose a role/agent who sucks on a map. And yes, I'd love a remake button. And the RR system work with that if you have high MMR and loses agaisnt low MMR players you will lose more but if the enemies have more MMR you will lose less. (MMR is like how good they are.) I don't feel like explaining the whole thing but the better/worse you are and the better/wrose your enemies are depending if you win or lose with will give the RR u get
Your getting way out ratiod here bud. You are a rare case of thats true because there 2-3 posts every day for the last 5 months complaining lol….. and before that not very much
Iso still has the potential to be broken as shit dw. A free shield every round is very powerful and 12 seconds is plenty of time to find value. Removing the two kill reset was a much needed change to reduce the snowball effect.
I'm looking to the bullets, i think there is blood too. 

Idk it is happening very often, sometimes i think is my internet, but there is no problem indicator or something telling me it is a internet side problem.

My peek is inmortal, sometimes i know i HS but i die due to this thing.

Idk what is happening but my mmr is going down this season, i'm not killing like others season, my HS % is goind down from 30% HS last season, to 18 % rigth now, it have been alot of times i HS someone but the game register it like a body shoot.
Everything higher than 1 is decent. Personally I think that 1.5+ is a high K/D, but yours can certainly be considered as high. You kill more than you die
I have a 2560 x 1080 monitor and I was told by support I cant play fullscreen so for the past 1 - 2 years I have been playing windowed mode with 1650 x 1080 desktop resolution on windowed. TLDR: Its not by choice.
well yeah still can’t get the hang of deadlocks ult, any tips
is that because you dont have friends?
Biological gender is not socially constructed.

Maybe for video games, but in real life that doesn’t make any fucking sense.
Just confidence I guess. I'm too afraid to play ranked on my main account, since my friends all outrank me and having them watch me struggle with ranked on main gives me anxiety lol.

On an alt where no one knows or cares about me I am playing for personal improvement and I'm less likely to not choose the right, but risky, play. Winning and losing matters less than learning to do the right thing.
Yeah it's either sexism or sexual harassment. There are rarely proper people, but most times there is at least one comment on gender.
Ohh nbm then , I am in the opposite side of the world lmfao
Hmm, its still used as a distraction or short check, forcing people to giveaway their positions or clear the path. Idk, its riot, they might buff her later on as well as buff wingman because of it 🤷‍♂️
I think it's meant to be an artistic choice. Not for everyone, but I think it's intended.
Boogie bombs.

"It's not enough to win, others must fail."

If I had unlimited boogie bombs, I think it would be possible to win merely by having the opponent unable to out run the last storm circle.
I don't think so. I have the same account linked to my Switch and I was vc with my dad just fine when we played yesterday. But I was on Switch, not Go
I don't buy Battle Pass for the skins, I buy it because it's the most practical and affordable way to earn 100+ Radianite.
if you ever start a sentence with "I'm not doing <x>, BUT" you should think very carefully about the rest of the statement because you might just be doing that exact thing even if you don't want to.

No, why do you queue up for a Swiftplay and want to surrender?? It takes time to queue, agent select and load into games, and you want to surrender? If you have to leave, then just leave.
If you wanna frag out with agent go kayo and not Reyna if you play Reyna as only duellist you need to go first and people like you send me first and then flank traps go down and then you cry “ehhhh cypher why did you die? We had no traps ehhhh“

ive played since beta and have spent roughly $250
There's a difference, practice is playing with purpose. 

If you're learning more about different agents, getting experience on different playstyles, focusing on how you can improve, it's practice. 

If you just boot up the game and play the same way over and over again, don't expect different results.
Got it, guess I just gotta keep on practicing to get used to his setups
Don’t do it save yourself.
what? bro just play the game, u dont need any knowledge nor skill to get gold lmao
It's not meant to be viable for a full round. It's meant to be situational

What game doesn’t have a cheating problem? Sigh
Everyone can lose game no matter how good they peform. I was warching johnqt and sacy playing in eu competitive in low immortal and they lost a game while both fragging/igl. Check something and forsaken playing duo on their riot accounts in eu, same thing losing few games in low immortal.  Some games are just lost. Also all the games you lost, they were pretty close, they could’ve been win.  I was playing on low immo smurf last act few games and I lost game with 46kills just cuz my team was pretty bad, shit happens. There is alot of boosted/bought accounts in low immo too.
Oh yeah, I heard about this! Actually insane. How little awareness can you have of your player base smh
yeah that's mb 

I should've highlighted the part where the guy explained it
Infinite teddy just like that sounds pretty op

Its pretty easy lmao because they wont shut up about it most of the time, saying stuff that girls arent good at videogames or that they suck so guys on the team tell them “noooo you dont suck you are playing very good”
they can tell me what to do before i do it, then i 90% of the time do what they say. 

but i had many games where someone calls "play time" and they peek and get shot. if they then say "why did you do that" i think its warranted.

of course keeping to complain into the next round is different but you know what i mean.
There is a TON of on screen text and it can get lost in the visual chaos, but it did take me quite a while to note the trap vulnerability in the description and actually realize what I had to do, but I'm old and senile.
& russians/french in eu servers 🫢 it's genuinely terrible
You have more than a “pretty quick” reaction time if you can consistently turn Phoenix flashes. Key word being consistently. I’m pretty sure there’s only been 1 Phoenix flash turned at Champs. Every other one just got nobody because there was nobody there, or full flashed them.
Bro I'd carry your ass to diamond just using the classic if I wanted to. I'm the one who would carry your ass to rank up. You're just so bad at the game you can't admit it's your fault if you don't rank up. Can you please, I beg you, upload the pov of one of your game. We'll see who the low IQ is. 
Still 0 arguments from your side to show why I would be wrong. I guess because there are none going your way
If my team starts doing it, I hold the defuse key down and wait for them to stop diffusing. 

You are not the main character.

> If that's okay to do, can a Christian / Muslim / etc not also argue that religiously themed characters are OK to be introduced into the game? Even if you don't believe those things to be real, they do, so what right do you have to say no? It's the same argument for introducing gender related themes.

i have literally never heard a trans person oppose a character being a christian or muslim in media but i hear cis people complain about trans people constantly lmao
Chamber isn't THAT terrible. Deadlock should be D. Yoru should be C and that's generous.  Omen should be S. Reyna and Phoenix D. Breach should be B cuz there's no fracture nowadays. Sova A, he's good but he's not S tier good. Maybe S with prep work but if that's the case KAYO should be A as well.
Boostio did this on EG lmao
This is such a minimal min max lol, just shoot him if you really care that much.
Most of what you see on this sub (excluding the lost BR players) are veterans who played for years and have done nearly everything the game has to offer. Yes the updates aren't consistent at all, we never know when or if we get a new update. But don't let that hold you back, there's so much content that it will take you a longggg time to finish the game. The amount of hours and content in the game is defiantly worth it for the price.

A few things to take note:

Public lobbies for the most part are terrible and people are toxic. You'll have to get used to playing alone, with a friend, or people from discord. There's various discord servers for save the world and full of people looking to play with others. 

Like I said before, updates are pretty scarce but that shouldn't be a problem for you at least for 2 years unless you speed through the game.  But that isn't to say we don't get updates at all. Actually, in a couple days we get a new venture zone which people are pretty excited for. 

It is quite a buggy game, but it's still very playable and it's never stopped me from playing.

It's quite a 'grindy' game, meaning you will have to put hours into something, whether that's getting the resources to level up and evolve your weapons, getting the resources to level up your survivor squads, or getting enough materials to build your homebase.

It seems a lot of people are interested in Save the world for Vbucks. Unfortunately, you won't be able to earn vbucks from daily quests or mission alerts, that was only for people who brought the game pre-2020. But the Save the world starter pack comes with a quest and you can earn 1500 vbucks. So if vbucks are your priority then I wouldn't bother.

&#x200B;

Overall, it's a great game and you'll defiantly get your moneys worth in terms of hours put in. If you don't mind anything I've mentioned then I hope you enjoy the game!!
You said MEDIUM bots. What about hard bots? With them the only real way to kill them is to click head. They are good for fixing crosshair placement, and I personally also used them to determine a somewhat optimal sensitivity. Now I can't do 180 from the middle of my mousepad tho....
Exit lag will sometimes be wonky as well.
actually I have southie nevermind I can make this work lol
ngl spectrum ghost would go hard
You would just need to lower your in-game sensitivity as it's better to have a constant mouse dpi incase you play other games.
now that might be a skill issue although the ai in those is very inconsistent in being terrible and insane at the same time
you just kill them to counter though, idk what else u could really do against them besides playing retake if its too much

"Ayoo how's it going boys and girls? Yall ready to win this game?"
I believe the devs of quake or some other older game discovered just this. More powerful sounding guns inspired more confidence in players.
Have a game plan for each site on Attack/Defend so you don't play on autopilot and know what need to be done.
Haha no worries
it’s boring if u play passive and play for lineups. i personally love playing trade/anti so i don’t get mad when i play smokes. ofc i still have lineups but most of the time, an extra person on site > lineup larry
No, but you can get walled off and without a way to escape the other traps.

I think if the community was toxic like CoD or Fortnite, Valorant would not be popular.  
The 'Features' of the game make it a bit stale and slow, and very punishing.

Skins are out of control expensive, mechanics are not great, Pearl (the map) exists - But team voicechat is like 90% the most wholesome fun gaming I've had in a decade. Win or lose, the community is pretty chill.
The only time we can ever tell someone is smurfing are streamers that do it during their live streams or records it.  Smurfing does have an impact for lower elo players and Riot are notorious of not doing shit about it.  Riot is unfortunately not the company to take these things seriously.
Taking fights early, rotating quickly, fighting with teammates, making sure you get trades, entrying when you can, etc.

You don't want to be last alive in clutch situations all the time basically.

Create a playbook on your worst maps. Pick one agent per map if you’re going to flex roles and instalock it every time you get that map.

When does beta and codes come out if I'm here in Texas
Yes and no. If you’re playing VAL on high sens, you’re putting yourself at a MAJOR disadvantage. It’s a low sens game by design. Can you go pro on 800+ edpi? Sure. But if you’re currently below Imm and your edpi is above 600 … That’s probably what’s holding you back.
i like the map, mid control seems very essential for both sides, can catch rotations offguard

sometimes it seems way too big for rotations to take place but probably just me not knowing the map that well
Every time I see this I've been trying different sequences to see if it triggers something, so far, no luck
Bet I would dance take the L on you
The longer you don't play, the easier it gets. Zowards the end of the act people will be closer to where they belong again.
That's what's so dumb about this system, it actually encourages you to take a couple months of a break.

I finished this banner a few months ago and I just had to do save 50 survivors for my 130vbuck daily mission. Other than that I just hoverboard on by them lol.
Meh, i completely run it down in unrated (hold w go kill or die), yet it took me less than an episode to go from hitting lvl 20 to hitting ascendant. 

The only way to get better in ranked is to play ranked. Unrated is a completely different environment

The wall on A site is good because there are many complex angles that it can cover (belts, nest, pipes, maze entrance). An orb smoke cannot cover those types of angles, so think about why wall controllers are so strong on breeze as another example. It also can counter sova retake darts well. 

Plz keep in mind that your wall on A can severely hurt your teams ability to trade or play aggressively. You should ask them to comm for wall up and tell them like 3 seconds til wall down. It can also obscure teammates who are holding the rafters to belt angle with ops, effectively giving enemies a free push. Be mindful that u are impacting your teammates game. I've been pretty annoyed with vipers that think they are keeping me safe, but actually hurting my position by putting up their wall.

In high levels either Outlanders or Ninjas.

Unfortunately, it's a very standard thing in Low Elo. Besides that, most players don't know how or what to communicate as they are pretty clueless about proper ways of playing overall. If you want high quality cooperation and coordination, you should look for premade players that are eager for teamplay and train/talk with them a lot.
Sir, the only thing we attack here is husks.
not long it's just the fact you can complete everything you want to do in half the time and are stuck sitting there for multiple minutes.
Its a gimmick.  Anyone sponsored by this product is paid to say it works good..  If it doesn't have a free trial,  Don't bother.
This is stw subreddit not br.

I use to play br Back in the first chapter back when their were only 3 llama so this would be very rare but I don't know if they changed the amount of llama in the newer season.
What emote is this?
When they ll fix matchmaking?
Can I have a code please
Just turn off chat, most low rank players just like to blame people for everything and have egos larger than the whole universe. Just mute and not let those people tilt you. Do some warm ups everytime u play and maybe some aim training?? And u will improve, this becomes so much better when u get to diamond
"save the world zero build"

Yoo do you know if we’re gonna get NDA cooked for talking about it since it’s already been announced, using common sense there’s a couple of things we obviously shouldn’t discuss off the top of my head but like hopefully we can tell people we HAVE played it
Kayo!  I main Raze, so when I try to initially push and clear and I can't use nades or my bot to at least distract, it's like a hard stop on your initial push to site. 😭😂
I tried Valorant, went back to CS, and it was not the same. I did miss the unique abilities, but not over the top movement stuff like in overwatch.
Knowing that the Standard edition now costs about $ 200, the Ultimate edition can cost 800$+
Mmmmm ok.

I’ll just use the low rank as aim training and get even better i suppose…
well played, gg
Yeah holy shit I don't need you stomping all over B site man how else are we meant to bait out the guy taking orb why is it play slow now? I can say "let's play it slow" in chat easily but if I said "be quiet" it absolutely won't go well
I am S3 and I have similar stats as you but I have 60%+ win rate. One advice that helped me was not to play too many different agents. 

You are playing everyone, play one or two and you will learn how to play them at a higher level.
I play at 30fps sometimes when I'm on the second pc. Peekers advantage is a lot more annoying to deal with but it's playable still. If I were to check my play history, I don't think I could point out what games we're at 30fps and what ones were at 240

At ranks that low your playing mostly with people that has poor reaction time and aim. There's nothing stopping you from learning the basics on low fps in the meantime.
Hey yeah I am home almost everyday before going to work and my game is not lagging and sure I would like to improve!
Yeah That's extra bad, but even the ground slide is very menacing for me. I'm kind of a piss low and I don't click head hard, which mean any half decent Neon forces me to give up the BP when she's running at me if I don't play Cypher
Go back to PC then????
Damn, this is great
I think lowering it gradually is good. 

I naturally lowered my sens over time when I started playing just based on intuition and how it felt personally. I never really had any issues. I have a friend I play unrated with who uses 800 eDPI. He knows it’s sub-optimal, but every time he tries to change it, he makes a drastic change, gets frustrated, and then changes it back.
also the moment you got enough to buy an operator youve already won the half.

Nothing to worry about. You're not at fault for anything if they just dropped it off to ya. Besides, them perks on just the one there looks kinda terrible. Idk what all the setups are for the traps you got, but you can always use em in lower levels or "recycle" them if you can craft a better perk setup.
Write a ticket to valorant support, they will help you fix it, if it's only valorant. They have really good support :)
>Conspiratorial

indeed, I wasn't sure myself
No one says anything about removing any husk. The thing we're talking about is to make sure that maybe the aimbotters miss one or two shots instead of hitting everything 100% of the time, even while trying to evade them. We're talking about dissolving the trail of bees faster, so that there isn't an abundance of bees everywhere. We're talking about giving more resources while harvesting, or in particular zones that may be. So, no, you're seeing it black and white, while there is a whole big grey zone that we are talking about that can improve the quality of gameplay.
Joe?
- Duelist

Despite a lot of people thinking duelists should always have the most kills, your main job is to create space for your team. 

The most common example: Jett dashing onto site. This means the defenders have to focus both on the enemy team walking onto site and the enemy Jett who is already on the site. This makes it easier for your team to enter site. 

On defense your main job is often to go for the first fight and try to instantly make the round a 5v4. Obviously there are exceptions, but in general this is their job.

- Initiator

Their main job is to make their teammates' life easier (often the duelist). The Jett has a much easier time getting onto site if their Initiator helps by flashing, stunning or using intel gathering abilities like Sova Drone or Skye Dog to clear angles.

- Sentinel

Often their role is information gathering. Most of them have abilities that give you info on the map. A common example is Sage's Wall. If you place a wall they either have to break it and give away their position or if they don't break it you know there's nobody coming that way.

Every agent has at least something that gives information on the map, some more than others.

- Controller

Basically just the ones that place smokes. I think that's pretty much all you have to know.

Now among those agent roles there are many differences between agents in the same role, but this should give you a general idea. 

Now as you asked about what guns they use, that's basically the same for every agent. There are some minor things like Jett and Chamber who are often considered as "snipers" (just to put it in simple terms) as they both have an ability that let's them escape after taking a shot. In general though, guns are not really agent specific (despite some small things but I won't get into that to keep it simple).
400 0.3
Depends on gamemode, if it's casual, I'd join in maybe even if I'm clutching

If it's comp, then preround and post round only. If they start chatting when I'm clutching, I press my clutch mute button, which I set to as '\'. I won't tell my team to shut up afterwards though, that'll just make me look like an asshole. And I obviously won't tell them to shut up mid clutch, since that'll distract me even more, and plus, I can mute them

If a teammate is clutching and my fellow dead teammates are chatting, I'd say smth like, "y'all stop talking, let him cook" (in comp only ofc, if unrated, I'd join in on convo likely)
Don’t worry, it’s also frustrating in high ELO too.

It’s just a really hard role. The best controller players understand how their teammates want to play and make that as comfortable as possible. Then they layer on clever outplays and aggression when necessary.

The most important tip I can provide is that you really need to live and breathe your minimap. You should watch your teammates moving and understand what they will do 5 seconds before they do it. When they collect info for your minimap, you need to process it and react instantly before they even communicate.

Second tip is pretty universal, but steal from pro VODs – especially basic utility. You should steal every smoke for a while and try to answer “why?” and “what was the plan?” about the utility. Bonus points if you learn how to avoid info starving your team early on.

Third tip is to really embrace making your team comfortable. Try to pick a controller that is common on the map as a solo controller. Learn common utility (e.g. flash A ramp on Split as Omen) that helps make your team comfortable. Try calling that utility early in the preround and see if your team positions for it on the minimap.

Implement some or all of these things and you’ll radically increase your impact and diff the poor low ELO enemy controller who’s really a Reyna main and can’t throw a smoke to save their life.
They are downvoting because of the last sentence lmao. Of course he doesn’t care about smurfs as much because he plays with one in his friend group.
If it was an account ban i think those are 2 year or so time based I could be wrong. You said your friend got banned to yeah? Did he log into your account? If he got an hardware ban then tried or used your account before it could spread like he used some hacks or something then got banned causing all the accounts he used the past to have the same issue? I heard on this reddit before someone got permanent banned same way after their account got hacked and they didn't have the hardware ban so riot lifted the ban later. I could be wrong but you can try asking riot for details ig
How did you get to diamond without needing to know this? Is your aim good?
I used to play reaper in overwatch and watching my teammates never pick smokes or they did and they looked horrendous decided I’ll do it myself

>because they didn’t put in the effort


Once again, why would they put in the effort,

#when they had a record breaking game that was doing infinitely better for them
As a cypher main myself, I hate playing against sovas and kayos, they’re both good on breeze imo
No idea what that’s supposed to mean
I kinda disagree with this, Chamber is all about off angles. If you put your tp on a box in haven, for instance, you can play from short, get a pick, and tp out within seconds.
Not arguing that that wont improve the game , of course they will.

I’m questioning Riots motivation to add these things to the game.

   * Waiting for a hard start of an Episode reset can speed this up as it loosens the MMR system and allows for faster movement up and down the system as it "recalibrates".
* Moderate Effort: Find a server where people are using forfeits and such to intentionally play in lower ranks. Its not a good practice, but it avoids hurting others in those matches. Might be considered an issue, then again I think the official stance by Riot was "whatever, do what you want" to intentional smurf accounts and intentionally deranking for easier matches... probably fine.
* High Effort: Find people to que with who are lower ranked than the account. Losses will take more, wins will raise less and you will have a lower average on the enemy team ie closer to your own skill than soloque will get you. IIRC 5 stack restrictions were removed a while ago, so you can get around the restrictions that 2 and 3 stacks get for rank band.
All Together Now (Rescue 50 survivors.)

Sounds like it would be a pain in the ass, but there's an unpatched bug with rescue survivors quests (shh, don't tell dad) that counts each survivor saved twice. I can finish a Rescue the Survivors mission in approx. 6 minutes in a public queue, so this quest never takes me more than 15 minutes.

Play CS2 lol
I like the messy
Imagine you’re winning so much, where would you be on the leaderboard?
Only his own personal fire I think. A gas main exploding means u die prolly
They might just be auto piloting and not thinking when they play so they forget about going with the team, etc. IMO,  whenever someone does this the best thing is to follow them as they clearly don't wanna go with y'all then u gotta go with them.
Valorant points or VP for short iirc. Radianite is for skin upgrades.
This ain’t Haddonfield no more 🙏

Yeah try to.


And lol the down votes 😆 I just said my age yo

Your mechanics are bad but you are looking to coach someone on getting better?
Yes please need one
I hover around immo3/low rad.  
Never did any aim training.  
I have 45minutes total in aimlabs.  
I do occasionally shoot bots for 3-4min(mainly for fun).  
(tons of hours in cs1.6/cs:go)
Is it just me or do I find it more efficient to leave him there with the husks.
I'm bronze but my pc is shit and lost many rounds because of it. Random fps drops, input lags on keyboard for almost 1 hour if I don't play Valorant after a week amd unstable internet connection even with net wire(now it's have fixed recently). That's why I play only in unranked. I can be easily silver without these problems because I almost hit it many times. Also, two my highest win rate maps pearl and fracture are out of map pool.
That cuddle team leader is gonna haunt my dreams now
Did you get anywhere with this ?

  
Fortnite ramps up my RAM and CPU temp more than Benchmarking tools.

  
5950x currently at stock / 64gb Ram stock or DOCP / RTX3090
"☝️🤓*" ☝️🤓
No idea. You're better off asking on their sub
With a 10% hs rate?
thank you, i will try my best and will send a dm
I feel the same, just bought time in wow because its more relaxed than just go in warmup 30 mins so i can play a game and then sleep.. if i dont warmup proprly i suck and get angry
Cheaters aren't the problem.


Smurfs are.
Yeah I don't skip it. I do 30 min of range . Overaim bursting. Deadzone etc. Then 40 min of Deathmatch. 
Sometimes even more of Deathmatch or range if I feel like I'm shit.
Like 2 hr sometimes. 

I've watched the vids I just really suck.
Because the Ariel assault trooper is rarer then the renegade raider because more people bought the renegade raider over Ariel assault trooper
that's me, in lower level missions tho, but either I build the base, then go farm or I farm first and then go help with the fight
Yes it’s dell
The overdrive collection white version looks really pretty with pinks and purples
I’ll start trying to play with a duo, cause as of late, there’s been zero comms, most of the time just being me and one other.
I think u will get a feel of it if you play some unrated matches, u will get used to slow movement pretty fast tbh
If its worth it for your friend to get there 6 elo at a time then lol.

Ummm No its out tmrw
i've never heard of cisgender being considered offensive to anybody who's not transphobic.
Just hit ascendant 1 as a 34 year old. Usually someone asks who the old man is on their team. Finally figured out movement and a quick practice routine. I still feel like garbage though but have learned the game apart from just aim.
You don't need to fill anything in swiftplay, its super casual.  If you want to practice something then do smokes and learn when and where to put smokes without wasting util.  You don't need an initiator with 3 duelists and the duelists will have the likely have the least delay potential
Don’t be shy post your tracker
just report them

not sure how active Riot is on console but on PC I get 3-5 people chat banned every day I play

Riot are one of the few companies that actually punish people for saying fucked up shit
I asked what rank is the most inconsistent not what ranked is the worst/hardest to reach
to be fair that would make your clip silver then. His aim with the OP was definitely at least Diamond.

Also your lying again the post said you switched over to try valorant because of the counter strike cheating problem not that you couldn't run it anymore like you aren't even that good at lying little bro
Raze and Gekko with their buddies: 👁️👄👁️
NEVER BACK DOWN NEVER WHAT????
Phoenix was my first main, I unlocked fade and yoru as my free agents. But still mained phoenix till I got around level 25. Then I started raining fade. Now I'm trying to get good with kayo to be a replacement main. I also play jett on unrated or swiftplays, especially if it's abyss.
I don't watch anime so I am not really understanding what exactly I am looking for here.

This is the only "valorant anime intro" I have seen so what makes it better than the other ones out there?
You do realize they released a new map just 4 months ago, don't you? Because you're writing this as if there are the same 9 maps since the start.
I always get really good skins like recently i had the elderflam vandal butterfly knives ion vandal radiant entertainment system phantom recon phantom theyre all skins i like but i really want the kuronami vandal
I have never seen such sens. I almost musread it as 0.11 and was like this guy is almost demon1
Worst thing about solo queue is when you get entire team of solo queue on your side and the other team is a trio and a duo and you lose 13-0 cuz other team is just more coordinated than yours
no idea  
i never add or accept friend from someone i don't know

all my friends still being my friends, that's all

i don't check my friend list either, and i don't care about it  
if i got invite, it would be on discord or something else than in game  
i just start game after that and join party
Stinger. I fucking love the stinger. The prelude skin is so fun, the sound effects sound just right, and with some practice on the gun you can even do decent damage at range. But the best part is of course run and gun
Let him know after he buys you a skin
cypher is way to op on certain maps  there is no counter play it forces u to play omen on sunset its insane.
Yeah my only concern from that would be the perk up used. What about pre crafted ones?
Pros fall between 200-400, not 550-2000??? 544 would be at the high end of what most people consider normal in Valorant.
Oh well I’d gladly take free nocs 😌, haven’t had had one in my inventory since 2018 💀
smartest viper player
Yeah? I'm unsure what you're saying as I'm not disagreeing with you. The aim assist is that it slows down as shown in the top voted [video ](https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1dm2wlv/this_is_how_console_aim_assist_works/)on the sub rn
Only 94 more matches until play well with others and I’ll be free of public matches
It's my PC bro, i can handle Smurfs pretty well.
I'm playing on a shitty laptop
Got 2 codes for xbox if anyone wants them
Am I glad we're playing a PvE game and not a competitive game mode...

you are looking for r/fortniteBR
No the keyboard is natively supported to chat with. You can plug/unplug as many times as you want
I’ve had this account since august 2017 I got stw for my birthday and been playing since, I have the Xbox account but for some reason I can’t link it to my epic account anymore and lost my progress. I’ve been able to get a live chat and i needed to end that one to grab more profile info to prove it’s me, since then I haven’t been able to get any live chat or anything. :/
Just impossible, only way is if they have peaked immo/radiant than fell off to asc end of last act to be in your game. No way someone ending the act immo/radiant places in diam
pistol round and save rounds

i dont like any other pistol for saves as i am bad with sheriff and not patient enough for shorty

ghost feels smooth and is very easy for me to double headshot
I mean I think it should be pretty easy? Orb mid and lurk there. Rest of team go A every round. Mix it up a little and you should be good. It's pretty hard to hold A if you rush it and use util properly.
I was banned from the server once, turns out they do read appeals because I wasn’t automatically rejected as everyone said I was going to be.
Prime, reaver, forsaken, sentinels of light, ion vandal and karambit, Gaia, protocol, ruination, araxys
LMAO yeah I would've uninstalled bc of that 💀
Before the recent patch that made Iso pretty busted, the game was in a very good state imo. 

There are definitely abilities that are strong, but there wasn’t really anything so good to the point where it’s unbalanced to me. 

Maybe it’s because you are returning and aren’t used to the abilities so counter-play seems hard, but personally I didn’t have that problem at all. 

Now current Iso on the other hand…

Anyway, would love to know which agents and/or abilities seemed “incredibly questionable” to you.
Me and my duo basically take turns being able to use sprays it seems lol 

It's such a weird bug.
I regret buying prime 2.0 and oni 2.0 bundles. Except the sword from oni 2.0. the rest is so pointless 

I don't buy 2.0 bundles or skins anymore. They just ride the hype of the first bundle and it's usually worse on every skin but the knife.
What upgrade are we even getting??
Oh, playing with others must be. Still curious about the reward though
Riot: We understand your frustrations. Which is why we've released this new skin collection priced at £100/$120 for you to buy go help you with this situation

has to be iron judging from you trying to jump the fade ult lmaooo. but nice ace

That’s ok, i love hearing input on people’s opinion on the meta.

While I do agree that the community can definitely learn a thing or 2 from Pros, i doubt that’s gonna happen, as to anyone who isn’t getting paid to play, Valorant is a game at it’s core. And games are meant to be fun. People will play in a way where they can derive the most fun, and for most, it’s unfortunately the no-comming, W-keying Jett/Reyna instalock playstyle we all know and hate. There will always be people in ranked (whether it’s iron or radiant) that don’t care about the deeper parts of the game
Bro think he playing DTB 💀
JasonR in this thread ?
any radiant crisis bat enjoyers? i love hitting ppl with onomatopoeia lol
I know I'm not the only person in the whole entire world who has it

My friend was stuck in gold for like 2 years. He just got out. It took alot of determination. But honestly im pretty sure if he just instalocked he would have been stuck for ao long
Still it happens far too often for the system to be considered fair and accurate.
I don't know if I'm not waiting long enough or what, since I open the game get past the loading screen and then it becomes unresponsive
You're ruining your own mental getting caught up in the enemy ranks and such.


Take your gunfights with confidence and take the loss as a chance to learn rather than reaching for the nearest excuse that stunts your progress.
I’d argue that asc is even mid elo
did u get it yet? i have the same problem and i cant even see the lowrider card in the collections
sorry to break it to you but you dont need to vod review and learn lineups to get out of silver
Or using wood cause of water and corrosion 😭😭
Please don’t use Lynx. There’s already enough Lynx users in this game.
Its smarter to just wait 6 months for the game to drop to $20
imho, baiting ruins the ace. its fine to gather info to see where the last is but full on baiting makes the ace feel unearned.
You can do this with Peace GUI and Equalizer APO! They're free online and I found out about them through another Reddit post. I personally find it really disorienting to crank up the left ear (I'm also mostly deaf in my left ear) so I don't use it, but it's great for situations like this!
Because the cosmetics are only as rare as epic makes them from how often they bring them back. 

 This is a way for them to get rid of that large range of prices and price everything at a similar level.
How about everyone just learn to shoot a damn gun?

I normally play Phoenix and just use his flash abilities around corners and go from there.  


But recently I have gotten Gekko and found that his flash ability mixed with a wingman spike plant is the best way to go.
LMAOO 😭 us bro us, my friends ask me to play games like CS2 but my potato can’t handle them 🤣
yes, of course ^^
tho my bad if it's not good enough.
That seems to be the crux of their complaint, hence why I basically said "idk why you're double pressing anything" lol..
Did everything get deleted and did people get banned?
That’s a good thing
When new agents launch the smurf population rises for the first few weeks. People want to practice new agent in a competitive environment that doesn’t risk their mains rank. It will settle in a week or two back to the typical number.
\>Does csgo have some lores as well?  


Not much  


\>Also what abt dota?  


No idea, never played dota
I did not use any kind of software, but i changed my monitor brightness and contrast.

this is definitely something limited to low elo players. giving advice on my main is always well received, while if i’m on a smurf - they always backtalk or shittalk any sort of advice
If you care about having fun then buy the one you like.

If you're serious about improving your gunfight hygiene/ climbing rank then buy Reyna.
It's very nuanced and situation based. I'm just reiterating OPs point that controllers helping in other ways than kills by effectively utilizing utility is always a large factor. I do agree with you, however.
The "me reyna, me swing" guy
honestly i never ask people to comm, if they don’t want to they aren’t going to, i just keep doing it myself and if we do well they comm, if we don’t do well they don’t oh well as long as their mindset is good, keep your mental up and try to keep your teams up bro, shit happens people play bad, the deciding factor is you in the end, some games arent winnable but you can always do better yourself
Nope only what the current bundle,shop,and sometimes the black market is what you can buy
I can’t pick it up anymore because I end up spraying cuz I want to see the reload animation. If there is a smoke, my whole magazine is going towards it
look at the map, you can get a lot of info from what your teammates see especially those who don't comm
i tried being a phantom player, but get 140 on a headshot is GARBAGE when the other gun has no drop off for the same amount of effort.
I just genuinelly enjoy the game
If you took more classes than just art you'd know how to use > or < correctly.
Since i started playing, I have checked my shop every single day, I even downloaded an app on my phone to check in when I can't get in my pc, and I literally NEVER got neither the glitchpop phantom, nor the reaver dagger. I started playing around 1 1/2 years ago
Personal issues with Raze probably.
The whole point of having a sentinel on ur team is to avoid having to have someone hold flank
Because kayo is a bad agent and doesn’t fit into any meta in mid-high elo 🤷‍♂️
Bot on a mission
Unrated is a practice ground same for swift play. What I see in ranked currently is that a lot of people don’t master there agents abilities. So they get caught off gourd when the enemy players are catching up to there play style.
You can just play customs with other people and teams if you're immortal and you love the game.
Only the one who equipped him on lead will count, it will not count for anyone who has it in support.
really your friend, or you? lmao
Because solo queuing as duelist is far better for your elo than anything else lol
His cage is unrecallable once the round starts. His trips can be recalled.
Only in valorant
I use the superlight and yeah I think my mousepad is ass. I think I'll switch back for a few days and see how it goes
Man, if you HARD grind today and tomorrow you honestly maybe could lol. Since you don’t actually lose your weekly challenges in this game and they just roll over instead. But it’d be a near impossible grind at that.
It's called the flying dutchman. It's a bit tricky to do but once understood can be replicated easily.
Is Founder the original STW package from like ch1? Cuz if so then I don’t have it.
It’s 100% selfish if used selfishly (which is almost 100% of the time)

There’s team play to be had. You get an entry kill? Use dismiss to take space for your team, not retreat. Or use heal and be the one to make first contact again. Pair flashes with other agents “pop” flashes so when enemy turns/play anti-flash they come right back to yours. 

Of course it’s way more fun to use your abilities yourself to ensure you top frag by 1 kill and get to blame the rest of your team for losing 2-13.
I think the SBMM has something to do with it
I just wish the left click was better tbh
If you get 20 fps.. i have my fps capped at 240.. i have 12 times more time to react than you do.. so like.. yeah hardware is holding you back extremely
0/10 no fookin laser sights
Cuz eeew nah
I like it, but not so much on repeat as the "Anthony" section kinda kills the energy it otherwise gives. Good for one or two listens, but I won't linger in the lobby just to hear it more. :P

But yeah I agree with others about making it a Jam Track.
Yeah but then you have no motivation playing the game if you have all operators f.e. Because the ship skins are behind paywall as well
There's something like that on CSGO, but I'm not sure how it works since other people can't see what you draw. Never bothered to look it up lol
u will comeback after a week, im sure xD
Is this not also the case vs other good players? Would there ever be a situation where you would take a disadvantaged fight because you think you'll win anyway?
Reyna
It’s more rampant in lower ranks, as someone who has multiple alts for friends of all skill level it’s really toxic is gold and silver compared to diamond in my experience (NA)
You did it to the Jett to lol, crosshair was closer to the other guy but auto lock the Jett lmao
That just means you gotta grind more. Play more comp, do more aim training, vod review stuff like that.
[removed]
Sage/Rayna main.  I get distracted very easily.  I appreciate when players ask for heals.  I will heal anyone who asks as long as it's ready. I will let them know how long til the heal is ready.   I will often die trying to heal or res someone especially when trying to get line of sight for the heal.  If I'm sage, that's my job.  I play the part.  

That being said ...

There are a few good reasons mentioned here but the main ones aren't. 

1. Sage mains:
Heal is not available.
Player has no audio.
Player is a troll.

2. Players main is taken so they pick sage as a backup:
I have 4 players that I play well. Sometimes the team locks those 4 and I am stuck playing someone I am not good at it don't really like.

I assume this happens to people as well and they pick sage, not really knowing how to play her or maybe for the first time.

3. Player picks sage because they have bad aim:

I often prefer to play sage when I am having a bad aim day.  To be fair my aim is pretty bad in general, but some days I get under 10 kills on TDM.  Without the Rayna heals I have no chance on those days.



Remember it's just a game and while ranking up is fun and stressful, the lower ranks are a mix of people just trying to have fun and learn.

When you have a teammate that disconnected on the 1st round of the game you can write /remake in the chat and a vote to cancel the game without losing rr will come up, there is no reason to vote no unless you want to 4v5.
Well, can say I haven’t seen that one before. 🤣
Sure but it’s always centre screen because that’s like where the bullets land???
You're in the Save the World subreddit, where the only vehicle we've got is a [hoverboard](https://youtu.be/aVhgauIzf2M?si=tEm3GozeaDvnC407), the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR
It’s not the toxicity that bothers me, it’s just the fact that it kills the match, when one starts to be toxic, other tu fell for it and go full toxic mode too, every one just doing what ever and die, no team play just toxic ego kids rushing where they want and throwing winnable games ! That is what makes me sad about those people. They are just ruining the « fun » of the game imo.

People can call me what ever i don’t care, I’m new, I’m learning I can only improve, those people have 1000h and are stuck on my elo..

> just go and look at the price of the old magepunk bundle/knife price and the new magepunk bundle/price

Magepunk 1: Ghost 1775 VP, Spectre 1775 VP, Bucky 1775 VP, Marshal 1775 VP, Electroblade 3550 VP. Total bundle price is 7100 VP

Magepunk 2.0: Sheriff 1775 VP, Guardian 1775 VP, Op 1775 VP, Ares 1775 VP, Shock Gauntlet 3550 VP. Total bundle price is 7100 VP

---

Magepunk 3.0: Phantom 1775 VP, Vandal 1775 VP, Sparkswitch 4350. Total bundle price is 6127 VP.

The only thing that got increased was the knife price. 1 different price in 13 different guns and skins. What the fuck are you talking about bro???

Getting told not to kiss the wall before I peek. Instead I should distance myself from the wall so the enemy don’t get an angle advantage on me. I win significantly more gun fights now. ^•^
A map with moving sites, and certain parts of the map with those moving sidewalks you see in airports.
The craziest thing is how awful the cheap skins are. Like sure I understand not giving effects and custom sounds and finishers and stuff. But some of them aren't even unique, like the Smite skins are memed on but at least they have a graphic. The prism skins are just changing a color slider. The Sakura line ($15 each btw, due to the way you have to buy 10 and 5 to afford 1275R) are just the exact same texture made to fit on a bunch of guns. Oh god and the "holographic" line of Silvanus, Horizon and Winterwunderland where they just replace the textures of like 10 guns with 1 image.
They still do patches though with changes.
Sounds like you won the round. What’s the problem
Uncharted is always the one that annoys me most.  I hate when one goofy path or spawn means you hunt around 3 minutes to clear an encampment or survivor.


Smokescreen is annoying

Why does it say when you try to give your friends a nickname on Fortnite it says minors cannot set to alias
Your fps is literally more than 10 times mine lmfao
That knife is straight ass🔥
Honestly, I almost didn't even send my original comment because it's just so situational. Like, depending on where you are playing, grabbing that orb could cost you 10+ seconds and completely change the round. 

Maybe a better thing would be to just be more aware and pre round with your team for whoever is close to an ult. Some orbs are basically free and some could start chaos. 

I guess my point was that I wouldn't make it habit but maybe be more aware of your ult status and come up with ways to get that extra ult in a half. 

Team comp also matters. Like when I play Phoenix, I try to grab ult orbs because I can get an ult every 2-3 rounds. Like haven a long, I can flash around the corner or play off a Skye dog and grab that orb. 

Idk there's so many layers to this game. It's like an onion. Full of layers and it makes you cry
The weapon is balanced
I just said it was clutter… not that you can get use out of it.  In the early days some complaints were that it was to complex ( even though some may not think so ) I could see what they mean. 

Doesn’t matter because they let this game die. Cool, you have great mechanics in a game not many care about other then vbucks.
kayo is by far the hardest agent in the game.
I think you're in the wrong subreddit. 

I don't remember the name but I'm fairly certain there's a technical support subreddit. You may have to do some digging Good luck though!
Probably just another thing broken, this update botched a ton of really basic stuff that I don't quite understand *how* they would've touched. Multiple quests no longer give progress, opening the map while moving on keyboard and mouse halts movement, the class animations no longer show in the lobby, and over in Fortnite Festival there's a brand new Overdrive bug.
Well, since people like you keep making posts like this, I'm even more inclined to say ez ;)
Fire rate faster too tho
Just bring back the old 2 sec. flash time, and the blinded. No need for control.
Skill issue lull

Cs is so full of issues that most serious cs players who wants to play competitively gotta pay for services such as face it/esea because the base game servers and anticheat are so ass
Defenders should have access to site, though I agree with widening it. I’ll probably also add an A long
Dragon Scorch / BASE Kyle + Blakebeard's Stash
Shroud is a god aimer who could flick to your head before you can say "banana man". The rest of us are mere mortals who have to strafe between bursts as to not get instantly headshot because we are standing still.
as someone who was top .1% last episode I can tell u 73% winrate with a 1.70kd in 120 games at immortal 3 is a top 50 radiant smurf/blatant cheater, hope this helps
The glitchpop one bothers me too. I had an ace and when I went back to trim the clip I kept noticing how there was a big green blob of eye sore on my otherwise sleek black/gold glitchpop.
Lunar and reaver karambit
Flicking doesn't matter in valorant. Aim positioning/crosshair placement is the most important to learn. Also it's not in the video but my aim always suffers when I overuse crouch to control recoil. If you are doing this in matches, a tip is to unbind the crouch button. It really helps with practicing aim.
Killjoy (defense) full util - classic
Killjoy (attack) alarm - ghost (I think… I don’t remember if I can even afford both)
Haha truuee.  Worlds worst level 15
So what if sova and skye are slow onto site? The team just executed a site hit, either all the enemies on site are dead, or all of your team is dead which would have stranded the bomb. 
There is no hurry to plant the bomb.
I do have XEROFANG and headshots with it are so satisfying imma KUM
So, what you ask is literally impossible to answer at the moment, without irony. Riot for a long time just dragged the lore with the radivores and artifacts thing. Like, I know it's something important in the lore but honestly it was an extremely important point but very little explained lmao.

I, for my part, believe that Chamber may be involved with this issue of the hourglass group and Iso, but hidden. I don't think Riot just dropped the whole Chamber thing out of nowhere.

But this biggest fear of Chamber, revealed by Fade, is something curious to think about, as perhaps lowkey implies that Chamber has an anxiety/self-esteem problem, but it kind of "burys" all these concerns with this confident persona of his. I don't see many people commenting on this fr.
Lets be clear about this, it's just USA, China and Russia :) In europe we have kinda strong policies on data usage etc
Lucky man, my girl sees me on the game and sees it as a way to get rid of me for a little bit 😂
There is a literal guide on YouTube called "Boomer to Diamond". Full time job. Father. 40+ years old. And I think no prior FPS experience, not sure on that one. Literally anyone can hit diamond if you practice properly. You don't need to invest crazy hours into the game to get good.

Want to sub in for our premier team on Thursday night? We need 1 to jump in for a game or 2 for us as our 5th is not available.
I’m in silver and I was playing Quick match and we had a diamond on our team and they did the worst in the lobby
Yes, you are definitely right. You can't focus on everything. You need to choose 1 or 2 goals and focus only on that. At the expense of the others aspect but you need to make it an automatism

And when you feel good enough on those, add new one etc
Definitely Plat - Diamond personally. A lot of imposter syndrome (conscious or unconscious), and it's comparatively worse when it comes to ego-based performance. See it a lot in streams + spectating lower ranked friends...

I understand people saying maybe Silver - Gold, because of the arrogance/pure chaos that takes place, but it's arguably worse in Plat - Dia. Mainly because people there actually think they know so much that it feeds into this egoistical loop...
I've said this in another comment but there's really a lot of things that can't be measured in numbers. This system is so bad istg
Yapping before the game? What differs yapping from literally just trying to have a conversation. How can you say someone’s yapping in the PRE GAME
I have never, not once, fallen off vertigo. Didn't even know you could.
That's actually good holy shit. I wish I had similar skills
Time it takes to kill with a stinger is quicker than a spectre. It just is very satisfying and gives you an upper hand when the enemy has rifles and you’re on a eco/bonus.
too much negativity. would play unrated just because i was bored but because i wasn’t sweating and put my absolute all into it instead of trying to have fun, I got called slurs more often than not but also it got worse when they heard my voice (im a girl) 🤩. Also overwatch has pretty women so yea
It's well known to be a scam, but at the same time, you can get hundreds of them for a fraction of the price if you simply grind out the battlepass. I currently have 1,700 Radianite point. Never dropped a single penny on the individual Radianite points and I'm pretty much set for life at this point.

No who gives a shit.
A) If you help build the tower, you get the reward underneath upon its completion. If you don’t it’s a nothing burger.

B) They want to show they can build faster than you…..just like the race to the next encampment in CTE.
Makes sense, it doesn’t burn Phoenix ult out instantly  either
They should add a new game plus tho.
Decreases performance for a lot of ppl and is just in general 10x the hassle. If it was so easy (like if Val had it in game) everyone would do it.

I still think double barrier is weak. I never said barrier + trip sentinel is weak on attack. In fact, it is strong and played in pro play on Split. Double barrier is weak because there's no active flank watch, and you need to get real close to support your team, so lurking is weird. With Cypher, you can make space with your cages and cam a little bit. With KJ, you can bait ur turret or use the molly to flush areas. And you can duel with Chamber.

With double barrier, you're putting a lot of pressure on your duelist to entry. It's good if you can win dry duels though.
Because if you're better at aim than your enemy then abilities simply don't matter. I lost a game against 5 duelists because all they did was rush in and headshot our entire team. This was in Plat diamond

The only thing I hear on EU servers is German and French, and when I ask if we can swap to English so everyone can someone can understand call outs I'm met with some nice foreign swear words (as if I don't understand a little french). - I mute most of my games and just use the in-game call outs as call-outs.  


It has somewhat indirectly helped with my minimap awareness.

Because the model is less likely to clip through walls when trying to hide behind things.
As long as he doesn't throw games it's not a smurf. That said, burdening your teammates with this "classic only" shit is really annoying so fuck him nonetheless.
yea this is even worse than the delay earlier today lol
Trios are just as bad as 4-stacks would be if it were allowed. Except now they ruin the experience for two players instead of one.
Communication is just vital to winning.. It's going to be hard for your teammates to read your mind and vice-versa when setting up plays.

I don't really get why people get way too toxic at people who don't have a mic, though. Winning with a teammate without a mic is not impossible. So yeah, people are just shitty sometimes (or most of the time)
Technically yes, but in diamond+ elo a lot of people will literally say “omen play off my contact I have 3 HP.” Trying to strategically guarantee the trade. Trading and baiting are all very situational.

Absolutely agree. Epic is literally killing their main source of income. Before I just played because the story was half interesting and could be fun with friends. Now theirs no reason to play cause their obsessed with meta verse shit.
no wonder ur like bronze-silver just lower ur sens
Don’t do it to yourself.
This will probably come off as harsh, I don’t think it is possible to develop utility good enough for your rank in the time it takes to rank up from mechanics if you are truly grinding. I first hit immortal playing gekko only, igl’ing every game to take those variables away entirely. It was only after being in what some people would call “high elo” lobbies that I realized it was a waste of my time and energy on people that genuinely do not care. Of course all common practice is completely off the table if you are playing with a macbook. I mean at this point this is beyond whatever tf op was talking about. I’ve coached several people to whatever rank they wanted, and the only ones that ever got anywhere were the first to throw out the idea of teamwork. It’s an imperfect game and trying to vouch for what it offers when it clearly is just the same as every other high elo experience in terms of “teamwork” will just leave people salty
A phoenix he could have ult or even if he just has a flash. Theirs a lot of insta flash pop tricks with phe to really body someone
The solution is to remove the damage effect of her molly and roll back the other nerfs they pushed on fuel costs. 

It's a bit of a hit to her identity and line up Larrys but the effects of no damage would be huge in neutering her ability to do it all, allowing them to focus harder on her toggle smoke identity.
Chamber after spotting an enemy with trap:  
"There right there!"
Then what would be considered a fair trade?
I never really sticked to CS and I don't know why, I guess it still felt too close to the game I  was playing when I was very young so it pushed me away. I'm sad because I actually have more friends playing CS than Valo (I mostly solo Q even in Valo but still play) 

When Val came out, there was just something about it that made me want to play more. Still playing today and when I go on CS to play a few matches with my friends, it hit me right in the face. The biggest difference for me is that CS feels empty after playing Val. 

\-The characters interactions makes the players and the game way more alive and I like those kind of stuff in video games. It's either the little sentences at the start, or a character saying a line after a satisfying head shot, or all the solo voice line each character got, some are actually very funny and yes, still are after all this time.

\-I know it's not for everyone, but I like the cartoonish graphics, also the maps are generally more colorfull and less ''sad'', less like ''real maps'' too. 

\-I was talking about how empty CS was, another thing Val did great, the kill sound. It just makes it so satisfying, plus the fact that it adds up on every kill on the same round, it's all those little details that makes a difference. 

\-Skins, also another personal opinion but let me say this. Yes the ''average skin'' in CS might be better, in a way, but it's all they got. I mean that a good skin in CS, is a skin that nobody will buy in Val. CS skins are just color skins, they are ''battlepass skins for Val. In Val, the shape of the gun itself changes from a skin to another, it got a unique animation and reload animation, unique shooting sound and kill sound effects and 4 different colors scheme on the same skin, why would I pay a tremendous amount of money for color change in CS after seeing that? 

\-it might be true that CS has more cheater, but Val have a serious smurf account problem since it's free and could be seen as the same as cheating for some when the level is way different. But I guess it's not a problem you'll encounter if you are a high level player
Stand tall, you cooked!
if you wanna play Sova the best out there is still AverageJonas
It's only hard because players in publics, particularly at the lower level, are only there to complete the daily for some shitty tickets, so they ball the instant you hit wave whatever it is. Nobody is there to play, ever.

It even happens in 128. As soon as wave 10 hits, people bail because they just got the weapon.

Every year. I make this same complaint every year lol
this is honestly why i never touched competitive when i was new and learning the game (never touched any other FPS games prior valorant). didn’t grind comp at all until i was roughly 200hrs into the game, got some sort of basic game sense and mechanical aim, so i did swiftly go out of iron3 to gold within a month or two. 

i’m only diamond right now but it did get funner at roughly gold where i played with lots of friends and met new people along the way. competitive will never be fun “fun” like the way you see vct teams throw their utility so coordinately it’s satisfying, but it’ll be fun in a sense where you can laugh with your friends and get the occasional dopamine surges when you hit really good shots

plat is where i found myself getting out of smurf games, but gold i do get majorly less than silver and below
Ok, how about the fact that you have the wrong shade of green, wrong hair length and gekko does not have a beard? You can have blue skin for all i care about, people shouldn t be forbidden from cosplaying a character because of their race, but you just look like a hippie in an ugly sweater, i wouldn t recognize that s a cosplay if it wasn't specified.
As a below immo player I can attest to not listening well lol
It’s gone feel slow more than half as slow
All those things are nice to know but if you check how pros play ranked you'll learn when to go where and what utility to use when super quickly.
Bulldog + heavy shield is crazy 2nd round. Enemy team is pretty much fucked on their eco. Sometimes I would have that bulldog for 3-4 rounds cuz I prefer it over vandal💀
True
Earsplitter, for a bonus you can truly have ONE weapon crafted and never need to craft another (if you use only heavy attack).
keep playing him if you enjoy it and feel like you can get value out of it. however, i do think it could be helpful to learn new agents. i used to only main fade but i moved to skye and realized her util was so much better and now i main her lol.

It should be all the way at the bottom of the shop, near the other bundles. It’s the Vinderman 2.0 pack. If you play on switch or mobile I believe you can’t get it.
That's more of an elo issue than anything else
No atlas mission is safe from lobbers at any level.
OP probably needs to take space more aggressively. A common problem with Cypher mains is leaving their setup untouched and rotating through CT spawn on Defense. OP should be using their cam to gather early info, and pushing through to flank if the opponents are avoiding their site.
I'll have an extra one if I get in. I'll dm it to you
instalock neon, blast white girl music, run it down. (i do this in unrated not comp plz dont come for me)
The main problem is long mid to long range vandal shots but I’m also just not good at controlling the recoil.
It's cause they are duped and are simple to get bloody annoying but yea

Is it bad to always crunch instantly when shooting? Yes. Makes you an unmoving target meaning your opponent finds it a lot easier to shot you. 

However it's also find to crouch sometimes. Randomly to throw aim off or after you've missed a couple times, sometimes it can be useful for spray control
You should not sweat if you are gold and aim to immortal, you should just play and have fun until you reach diamond 3, then you can start thinking about what should you do to reach immortal

Ive grinded the game since beta (currently asc2), and ive got out of silver at least 4 times since i started in gold. I couldnt stay in silver even if i tried, and its a pita bc all my friends are bronze. 

Ive seen the same arguments in every rank lol
Yeah……………………….
Got a 27 1440p OLED 360hz, I peaked Ascendant. You can definitely play with this size.
Ofc riot makes OP chinese agent. China #1
Yup unfortunately. Had to go take care of my kid and I just didn’t feel like dealing with it again lol
1600 .126 is not very high. It’s on the lower end of “acceptable” by woohoojin standards I play on .23 800, so lower, but still.
All the need to be is in possession of a mic and use it to benefit the team. Whether it is comms or moral, just use your mic.
yeah i mean stw can definitely be overwhelming since there’s so many different things so that’s so fair
Hard question ngl but definitely Sova, not because he has a bad kit, but everyone else is better.
Affects the whole lobby yes. All traps, including traps not affected by BASE.
That sounds about right bc I was using a Heavy-Attack spam build and I was constantly flipping in and out of Shadow Stance. \[Anti-Cuddle Sarah in the lead, Fallen Love Ranger, etc etc\]
Glass half full vs glass half empty
how I used yoru ult. tp at back as safety. go ult. scout. flash. take cover. clone. then shoot. Depending on situation i take some enemies or retreat.
It's not that but you can't call someone who has yet to win a lan a goat
Eh I see that one of 2 ways:
1) I've spent like 6 years on stw. That's less than $10/month, which is a perfectly reasonable amount for entertainment. $500 is a lot at once but if you're planning to earn it back over even 2 years it's only about $20/month. A lot worse things cost a lot more for a whole lot of people. 
2) Some people are just rich and it doesn't matter. Could be like $5 to them.
learn 5 agents that way youll always have one available and youre never taking someone else's best option

im best at reyna/clove/omen/fade/gekko, when push comes to shove i will always have an agent to fall back on (although preferably it doesnt come down to reyna)

Icebox is abhorrent but I find breeze enjoyable in ranked
Agreed. Unfortunately the game is full of weirdos, it's hard to avoid them.
I'd say no. I think the only defuse that would he considered 'ninja defuse' is just them not hearing the defuse at all until the moment its defused. Mostly this happens if they think you're saving and leave the area too early, or for example if you have utility that makes them deaf and they don't hear it, but even this last one is situational.

Still though I'm not a pro or an analyst so I could be mistaken but that's what I think it is. OP's clip though is def not a ninja defuse
If they’re being a dick I’ll mute cuz otherwise I’ll play worse. If they’re cool about it I apologize and explain it’s an off game
yeah I agree. My biggest issue is probably comms as well, since I really don't know what many of the spots are called. I usually play in a 5-stack with some irl friends and we have kind of made our own callouts.

But they just play for fun (and are lower ranked than me). So in order for me to solo q I'll have to learn all of the correct callouts on all maps.
His old content was good but now it's not really
Players when people try harder in competitive instead of unrated: :o
It has to be Raze. She absolutely carried me to Plat 2 from Silver 3. Having a bad day?? No aim?? Throw a nade, boom goes the rocket. Also her kit is really helpful for the team one way or the other
Get*
How can she do more if you remove overheal? You are literally nerfing her more, making her even worse for teamplay. This is such a terrible idea. Just say you are bad at countering a Reyna. Most people in ranked don't know how to isolate gunfights and it shows in their arguments against Reyna as a character.   


>I just hate overheal.

This seems more like a rant against Reyna from all the ranked more than a suggestion to make her more viable for teamplay. Just get better, in all honestly. She can be viable, but just not as much in creating space department using her movement. She would need a lot more help from the initiators in that case.
Not sure your point lol
it better be radiant crisis 002
Your anecdotal "evidence" doesn't mean anything. Clove has the highest win rate in the game. If you can't see the strength of their kit then idk what to tell you. I'm sorry your low elo clove isn't playing like you'd expect.
Like?
You gave it a shot and it missed. Don’t get too caught up in skins, it’s just some pixels on a screen so don’t let them turn you into an idiot.

IT's absolutely horrid. There are people in ranks that they should never be in.
I've been playing for 4ish months, most of my hours on comp. I initially got placed iron 3 and made it to bronze 2. I do run into toxic people, but the majority of people are nice and often people are very encouraging, both when I'm top frag and bottom frag. 

are people really that much more toxic at higher ranks? I've only had people using slurs a handful of times in the time I've been playing, and people only start flaming each other at all in 30% or less of my games
Cause I thought it was a one off remark, once I knew he wasnt going to stop I muted him on everything
I'm not transphobic. But pinpointing out that there are nonb people and we should act as they want is kinda wild...

And by international you mean USA? Because I don't see it happening that wildly around the world 🤷
If gekko enemy then gekko will get out of ult automatically and get detained wait i got a idea from this when kj ults u can use ur gekko ult to detain players in the area out of kj ult (when kj in same team)
Only way to find out is to contact Epic support. They'll be able to give you an exact amount and answer.
Boycotting will do nothing for this as this mode is mainly for children. Yes I understand adults play Minecraft (I do) and I know adults make Lego stuff but this mode is 100% for children Minecraft players more so than the adults who play  STW. If I'm understanding the "rules" of the mode, I can't even use my regular fortnite skins in there. No thanks I really like my skins and I wanna play fortnite with them on. Don't matter if it's stw, br or creative ... I wanna perma wear sabina or etheria.

We don't even know if this mode will be any good. I feel like the skins in this game are a huge draw and turning them into Lego characters isn't really the play but who knows. There's always a chance that all these new modes coming out will actually help stw as it will bring in new players. Maybe there's a lot of PVE players out there that still have a misconception about fortnite only being PVP.
If you bought vbucks and returned it to the store thinking you’d still get your money back without issues that’s where your wrong epic games knows when or if you try to return vbucks after you spent it
That would result in people getting kicked for absolutely no reason just because a 4 man feels like it
Fracture is so trash like why do you want to play on a map that is only good for the story line and not for the fighting and breeze is kinda to open for me personally
Aah... ty!
is your market still active?
yup

Obvious trolls will troll.

There is no positives for smurfs, if you're in gold and you get matched up with a plat then you might learn and improve but if that person is tenz or Currie... You're not going to learn a fucking thing that is positive. You will make the correct plays and decisions but get skill diffed, leading you to think that the correct play you made was incorrect. This negative reinforcement will shape your decisions into one's that are not logical or correct but might work against someone playing properly. For example you might hold an absolutely terrible corner that noone checks because anyone with a brain wouldn't hold that corner.... Because it's such a bad place to hold and because you're not playing properly or with your team, the smurf might not check that corner because you shouldn't be there. Then you kill the smurf and that dopamine hit in your brain reinforces the idea that your play was a good one... Which is wasn't, and now it more likely for you to do that again against people in your own rank.... Not understanding it's throwing regardless of whether it worked or not.

Its like the Reyna mains who get tones of exit frags and meaningless lurk frags but constantly lose. Sure their kd is high and they are top ragging, but they are also part of the reason their team is losing. Their brain has been convinced that their strategy is good because high kills is good, and top fragging is good, but they've never learned that not all kills are equal and playing with your teams strategy is better than playing a solo lurker. 


Smurfs are toxic children (age doesn't matter) they are seeking validation of their skill/ability through winning but aren't realizing that winning against people significantly worse than you means nothing, and proves nothing.
If you need backup, i'll be there, i'll use my stonehart build.

I'll probably be away for 2 days due to family matters.
Who needs diamonds when you can have iron? You're a true legend, my friend! 🤣
Fair point. Yet I feel like the only difference between the two is one is stunned and one is detained. Yes you can get a kill while stunned but it is quite hard and the dog does damage. So is gekko ult really that much stronger? Regardless of explosion range and being able to pick it up?
New player here.   What is save the world mode?
OMG I SEE IM SO SORRY GUYS i literally never use Reddit I’m sorry
i fucking hate this game it happeneds to me every single fucking time till i decided i will just not play the fucking game and is there any fix for it or i need to fucking get a whole ass pc just to play fortnite
Me every round we lose:

“Nt mb”
Time to stop playing imo. You’ve reached your goals! Congrats. Very good time to move on.
I hope you know this is not only sexist towards the girl, you're being sexist towards guys too because you act like we're some animals who can't control our sexual urges.

Very common mistake. Buying after winning pistol round is a must. It’s called anti-eco. If the ennemy team has only pistols it should be an easy round win. If ennemy team forces, you will still have advantage of shields and/or utility and better guns.

Dumb people being dumb (as in you), nothing suprising.
i was silver after playing for 2 years first fps game as well don't sweat it bro you're doing fine
I mean you’re kinda being a dick in this situation
I agree that there are a lot of smurfs and that they make the game less enjoyable. If you’ve played this long, you must know that this has been an ongoing issue and its unavoidable so there has to be some aspect to the game that you like. I know it’s frustrating to not move up in ranked / plateauing but you don’t need to be the very best at this game to just enjoy playing it. Looking forward to see you playing with us degenerates again.
Tbh sage, phoenix or gekko
No role is 'supposed' to have the least kills.

But some are better at helping teammates get kills.

I've played cypher and dropped 30 kills, I've also played duelist and dropped 10 (because it was a bad game and I suck)

I've also played kayo and had 20 assists.

As a controller it is better to stay alive and help smoke for your team (this is why clove is a good choice imo) than it is to frag out unless you are just feelingg it and playing well.
At that point they already have 144 weapons/ hero builds that do insane damage, But it's not realistic to the casual player.

Just started on console, Gold 1
I wish there was a notification that says your teammate is maining Dire, so I could quit and find another match asap.
Def just burst strafe the vandel, you should never really need to spray
Dudes brain just fizzed out
Now i have same problem
There's a lot of factors. It might be your latency issues. Another thing is experience. What you can see on your monitor and what you are actually looking at are quite different. If you focus on the center of the screen the edges are obviously blurred out a little. A player who is experienced will look at angles he expects enemies to be at. Obviously, with good sleep, caffeine and a little experience, you will do better. I am just 20 and have not played a large amount of shooters(unless GTA and Tank Commander count). I played CSGO as my first shooter at 16 and then played through the  Modern Warfare series(OG) and Black Ops 1. It will get better as you start moving your cursor by sheer instinct, just like an animal attacks a threat by pure instinct. 

A bigger issue might be your speed of noticing enemies. For that, you need to just keep your eyes around the monitor. Trust me, after some time, if you keep practicing with moving enemies(not the range), you will end up pointing your crosshair at the enemies heads before you even know it. Just make a habit of aiming at their heads and keeping your crosshair at the head level. It may seem easier to shoot their torso but eye-level crosshair placement is better in the long run.

Just stay alert and sharp and it will be easy enough to get better. I was hardstuck on iron for 1-2 years as I had only a miniscule amount of shooters experience, much less against LGBTQ people dressed in flashy clothes manipulating fire, life, wind, nightmares etc as per their whims. It is a little difficult to adapt to but you will get better. Trust me 🤗

The whole map is just choke points it's crazy

Bro don't overthink it, she's on Rito's sight. She's getting the Raze, Sage, Cypher, Sage, Sage, Chamber, Jett, Skye treatment.

She's getting gutted, that's what's going to happen. It doesn't matter if it makes sense, Riot decided she was being meta too long and she's not going to be meta anymore, period.

yea, he had his coms off in the pregame. played for 3 rounds then just left LOL
It’d have to do like 1 damage a shot in exchange 
Dm me! :)
Trust me yoru is THE MOST FUN agent to play but you need to get his fundamentals down, such as undodgeable wall flash (very simple flash off any wall when your face is right in front of it), flash tp timing (press e when flash bounces off the floor and shows the indicator) as well as proper clone usage (clone close to the wall and you peek far from the wall to maximize bullet shield potential) 

I also recommend hyper analyzing how yoru youtubers flash properly and maybe check out some guides
Sentence 7 is all you need to know the answer.
600dpi with 0.425 in game, would’ve gone lower but I have a smallish mousepad.
I honestly think this update is good tbh. Just sucks for anyone that was close to 800 or that special 1k daily login reward. Doesn't seem fair to those. We get what? 150 vbucks a week from the login daily reward.So if my maths is mathing, 50x7 (from what we've known) = 350 + 150 = 500.Now it would be 350 + 210 = 560.So we are now getting an extra 60vbucks per week on average if you do your daily quests.
You get harsher penalties if you do not play a lot but disconnect often. If you've only been playing for a week but disconnected twice from full-length games already, that's just the penalty you get. If you play for a long time and then disconnect twice due to issues out of your control (as happened to me when I upgraded to Windows 11 recently) you get a five minute cooldown or something.

If your connection is so bad that your regularly disconnect, it might be best not to play full-length games. You screw over nine other people if you insist on queueing despite these issues.
I can’t imagine how hard playing on a controller has to be, Ive had my pc for about 8 months but only about a week ago started playing valorant a lot and it’s so hard to aim and control the recoil

Yeah exactly. Also just feels so hard to get back to where you were before. It took me 3 acts to get back to diamond and not even d3. Idk why they reset people so hard it doesn’t make sense to me
of course it is LMAO
I agree
Judge, yes it is used a bunch in some lobbies or by some Players but the moment you notice that the enemies have used their dog/drone/boombot or don’t have one sitting in a corner with a judge is worth it even if you can afford a rifle. 

Especially on dive/smoke agents the gun is just too viable
Anyone got a code please PS5?
So long as the person corrects themselves or apologises for messing up, no one will get angry. My best friend is literally trans and when they shared it with me , it took me at least a month to actually stop messing up ( even though im part of the LGBTQ community, ive never been good with remembering pronouns * or even names * ) but if you just apologise, people will understand. Thats the thing - we don't want special attention, quite the opposite, we want the whole   pronouns interaction to just feel mundane/normal.

Because he likely has a lower mmr compared to you and the lobby as a whole, if you put someone with low mmr in a higher mmr lobby and they perform better than expected, they're rewarded with more rr, if you put someone in a lobby where their mmr is the highest and they perform as expected they aren't going to receive so much rr because they haven't performed any better than usual.

She’s not overnerfed. 

Now she has specific conditions to push you toward favorable engagements where you should dismiss instead of tanking down and gobbling soul orb after soul orb without repositioning. It has counterplay but also rewards you for being deliberate — getting traded after dismissing is unlikely now.

She has an incredible flash paired with two Jett dashes and an ult that lets you heal while doing that. If you can’t see the value in that then it’s simply a skill issue.
that was not general consensus from what i remember 

every single time a new agent gets leaked there are the same hordes of morons saying it's ridiculously OP and will break the game. its been true like, twice. the community overreacts just so they can throw a shit fit and complain. *i* clearly remember people saying yoru would be busted on release because he could tp. he was ass for months lol.
Basically any position that requires you to lock on and identify a target, never look.
This doesn't sound like u main astra, sounds like ur stuck in bronze though
That's gotta be worth a lot
Dude professions in gaming are incredibly competitive and unstable. Most people are not willing to keep up the grind when they are 30. You are playing a single game 9 hours a day, with minimum face to face interaction. To earn more you start content creation and are too poor to hire an editor. That’s like 15 hours work minimum with close to zero face to face interaction with another human being for months. This has nothing to do with gaming being for children, it’s the same with an overworked work from home employee (except worse because at least you get stability in most 9 to 5’s). It’s similar with F1 drivers and fighter pilots as well, the barrier of entry is high so they enter their respective careers later in life which is why I mentioned them while saying age is not necessarily directly proportional to having a good reaction time. You got defensive for no reason.
Would have thought silver-gold. Most silver gold 1 tricks know how to satchel if they main raze but theres a lack of util usage asides the double, no roomba out smoke/down vent , no nade elbow for ur team, not checking site on way up so ur not really clearing any corners for ur team whos making way on site someone could have been deep site + u swung out the smoke not being aware of ur back if anyone came from CT earlier or did a faster rotation u die there. Last two shots were nice tho
Mfw games dont work the same even though they both have guns and skins
Don’t play for 2 weeks. It sounds stupid but I went on vacation, came back to valorant, and voila it was like it just reset all my bad habits. It also reset my aim for a few days though.

Not just one skin gives me aimbot.

I swear, I feel like Kuronami lets me aim better.

Glitchpop may be bulky and all, but this skin also gives me aimbot.

Don't think I seen anyone say it but, the Overdrive skin always never lets me down, I can't really miss with this skin.
At least they talked to you, I'm 46 and every time I speak people just go dead silent.
starter packs are available for cheap.... they give you full access to STW.... often the value paid is what it would cost for vbucks on their own so you get stw for essentially free
This is one of the best pieces of advice I have ever gotten, thank you a ton

No, in this game your job is to play your agents role, and get at least a kill for every death.

It's the movement. It's always the movement. I'm D1 currently, and I have Asc+ players in my games tapping heads. I'd say they have no life but trust me when I say they have the worst or best tracking at times. There is no in between.

In DM, there are no consequences. So go apeshit and have fun with how you approach shooting an enemy. Crab rave while tapping a head or Ferrari Peek someone real close. Me personally, I like to go one match 20 kills with a sheriff or until I'm happy with my results, leave the Dm, then go do the same thing with a guardian. Then do the same thing, except with a Vandal. If Vandal isn't your style, do Phantom. If you think you're better with a ghost, do Ghost, Stinger/Bulldog, Phantom. You'll see results within the first 3 matches. 

Try to decrease the amount of time it takes to get those kills. If you got 20 in 5 minutes, try it in 3. If you get an ace or two, then you're seeing improvement. If you think you're just getting lucky, leave and use the same weapon again. If you see more than 3 people afk, just leave. It's not worth the effort. 

P.S I know I'm using the numbers 20 and 3 very much. But please understand that these numbers somehow make the magic happen, at least for me. There's just something about that ratio that makes things right.
i wish it was just 1k for me…
Players in Immortal 3 are saying this. Look at woohoojin just recently video and he ecplains it by the words I just said. 

So I rather question your rank for questionng it

You don't need old skins to be good at the game, [it's also against the developers' terms of service to buy/sell accounts too](https://i.imgur.com/ZHZBTb3.png), you'll get banned just for buying the account, it's the reason why [that one retired content creator became the default god](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzaGlfBDf2Y&pp=ygUPdGZ1ZSBnb3QgYmFubmVk) before [the devs force the fourth down football skins into his locker](https://youtu.be/d0vuWDkaTIM?si=czT-SzBEsbSaERgF)
The short answer is no.
   
The long answer is that for new players it doesn't matter whether a character is good because forcing a new player to play a meta character rather than something they're comfortable with would just end up making them significantly worse than if they picked a weaker character

Rule of thumb: as long as you can comfortably do 180 degrees in game without lifting your mouse, that’s good. 

At 160edpi you might come up a little short, but that’s fine, 160 is a totally fine sens. 

Generally 100-400 edpi is the most viable range of sens, 100 being the slowest and 400 being the fastest. Aim is more about how comfortably and consistent you are with moving your mouse, the rest comes down to personal preference.

Hey! So I only watched till round 8, but here’s a few things I noticed as an ascendent player:

- Your raw aim is fine for your rank till about gold, then you need to put in some work on pre-aiming more.

- I feel you are playing too predictable at times. EX. Pushing out from C site to spawn. Try  switching it up a bit and play on different sites or waiting for them to push. Learn how they play when you give them space. Don’t let enemies adapt to your play style.

- Building on the previous point, I notice you are being too aggressive at times. It’s okay to take lots of fights, but make sure if you take space, try to have a teammate to trade you.

- Be mindful about peeking. I noticed you’re rounding corners with WA or WD sometimes. Build a good habit of only using A or D. You will appear a lot faster on enemy screens and be harder to hit.

- Last point on taking gunfights! You don’t always have to commit to a gunfight. Jiggle peeking or deadzoning a corner while firing a few shots and getting damage is better than getting killed. You’re also providing lots of info to your team!


With the way you play, I feel you can easily reach gold or platinum. Good luck on your ranked journey and keep your head up!
Yes but people don’t believe so because iTs oNlY a pOiNt eIghT pErCeNt dIfFeReNce
In rare occasions it can be good, see the Viper orb usage on Sen's attack side in yesterday's game against 100T as an example. But it's usually a bad idea in ranked because it's a niche play and if you don't have the coordination to execute out of the smoke together you're just gonna get gunned down.
"you've been complaining about cheaters" too many logical fallacies in one sentence for me to answer. instead of reading my comments for "a year straight" time for you to get a brain surgery to get some IQ.
Do you have any proof of this? Just curious
It's an even smaller niche when you really think about it. If you're running into an OP, they're probably taking first contact which means in a lot of scenarios either you instantly kill them or you die because you have no shield. And if the OPer is on the other site then they're retaking with an OP which is already cancer. Which means Iso, in theory, only counters OPers who are holding mid. LMAO
I don't think I was Invited guys sadly :(
If you're already in Plankerton, do another storm shield defense. You don't need to be at that stage in the campaign to do one, AND you'll get 100 more vbucks (not including the separate 100 vbucks from completing the campaign quest, which you'll get later).
essentially if you’re not 15-18 you can’t exist with them
This has been working for me, not sure how it’ll work for you, but I have an alternative account. It’s not a Smurf, although it is ranked lower than my main. But it’s my rainy day account. I have bad days, I can’t play as consistently as I’d like to and so if I feel that ranked anxiety but I still want to play, I play on my alt. And I just focus on playing the best Val I can, despite my anxieties and I’ve really stopped being so afraid of ranked. I used to be bronze, I got all the way up to gold 3 on my main and typically around silver 3 on my alt. 

To me my alt feels less personal to me and for whatever reason it has tricked my brain into thinking failure is ok
Having fun with the rush bulldog and phantom,  and this cool bluish guardian skin that's also basic but I can't remember.

I regret not buying the infantry skins for guardian when it showed up.
might be the way to go to avoid this in the future
Good reply, btw wanna ask you how to display these agents near your name in comment box, actually new to reddit that's why asking
I can explain it in one word ,"2 bullets" . It's so hard to use it to hold a push in defense rounds . In lower ranks it may be viable but in higher ranks people don't do stupid shit and hold sites very nicely . I personally only used it in 2nd rounds after pistol but it fuxs my buys whereas a half shield spectre doesn't.
In my personal build clip,arch Jess, prehistoric Izza,fallen love ranger and Fossil southie requires a voucher to be researched. Path finder is the only one that requires Flux or can be found in llamas and mission alerts

But for dates on when the voucher required heroes for when they are available without a voucher are below

Fossil Southie comes back on June 19th and he is gain though the “hit the road” challenge “well traveled” and that challenge need you to “push the payload 1,000 meters”

Prehistoric Izza return to the Item Shop on July 17th. She costs 2,800 gold

Arch Jess returns to the item shop on July 31st. She also costs 2,800 gold

Cassie “Clip” Lipman (is her full name) returns on September 4th through her Venture Challenges “Clips Nightmare” or she may return in the item shop. If she does return to the item shop then she will cost 2,800 gold but it depends on what epic do this year. Sometimes she’s a item shop item but sometimes she is a quest item

Fallen Love Ranger returns next Year at February time. I can’t give a exact date for that one but he 

This information is by this list https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UOCfWQxMgdrjnf3TbUu3N3Dynx8eaSTG_-ThrO6SF-M/htmlview#gid=0

It might be subject to change 

Sorry for the slow reply. Reddit decided that it was going to give up on me for a hour
Knife is amazing, pull outs and finisher for all weapons are nice, sounds are ass and looks are alright. A little bit boring maybe.
I hate when someone tries to tell me what to do with my util or when I'm told to "just kill someone" in a post plant situation (usually on Killjoy). Even if they're technically right, when I'm in a clutch situation and someone is endlessly talking on comms about what I should or shouldn't do, it's really distracting and will probably just make me do worse in the end.

Doesn't really happen often though, maybe because I don't play Ranked.
You mean save the world? Yes it still exist however it’s playerbase is significantly smaller than BRs and isn’t very good
in ventures... it's not uncommon to spend an ENTIRE mission slaughtering husks with a weapon and then looking at the progress and see that it hasn't gone up one digit.....
I need xbox code I signed up and didn't get one. If I end up all give them out help
Viper didn't always decay 30hp immediately, snakebite didn't vuln, her ult used to drain teammate's health too, her wall didn't pierce, her fuel gauge drained faster if both wall and orb were active. Yes other characters were insane, but beta and 1.0 viper were fucking atrocious characters

First time i heard Cypher... "I am Prometheus, and you are just a God."   Really hit hard..love that line so much as an Ancient civilisation/history hobbyist researcher.

And also Neons I'll show them Lintik kayo,  a shortened version of a typical Filipino curse which I believe roughly translates to "I wish that you are struck by lightening " I find I use it while driving around on my scooter..
To render the snipers first shot useless off entry without getting first blood is nuts
You know it’s starting to bother me aswell now, didn’t really mind all the br questions but I see it every 5 minutes now, it’s getting annoying
Fr. Funnily enough i've seen a lot of russians default to english for callouts and while there are some bad apples, the amount of chill guys is not as small as expected
Log in once a day spend that hour doing it every 3 days
Actually I’m quite new to Riot. Made my account not too long ago so idk if that means something. I’ve seen Valorant here and there on streams but didn’t actively play it on PC. So basically I’m one of those brand new Valo console players for sure.
20fps is horrendous i can’t even play on 60fps but don’t just upgrade only because of valorant make sure you need it for other stuff as well
Tracker doesn't show afk/leavers, so how is this a relevant request?
Wtf why do you have so many X-ray tickets??
Then go ahead and get banned

Maybe you'll scam a kid in the process
I wanted to refund a skin on my account but it says that I cant refund used skins , how did it work for you?
Yea I don't get it.
Yeah, never really argued otherwise lol.
same but from gold to ascendant. Having even semi decent hardware can just remove the hidden barrier hardware presents. i know can get to immortal on 60hz 60fps sure, but they are by no means the norm. the way i see it, good hardware won’t make you better, but it will NEVER penalize you and it unlocks your true potential. tenz will still be tenz on a macbook on boot camp, but it doesn’t change the fact the 144hz or higher buff / high fps / good mouse buffs do exist
Exactly. Some people don’t realize how many hours in FPS games other people have. My friends couldn’t believe how easily I got to plat when I first started playing but I had probably 5000 hours in CS over the last 15-20 years let alone other fps games lol.
Thanks :)
Nah, the "gambling" issue was resolved years before by removing the blind-box Llamas and replacing them with X-Ray Llamas that you can see the contents of before purchasing.

When Epic removed the ability to buy them with vbucks, they did in fact state in their announcement that the reason was to not have anything that could potentially be seen as P2W in their game.
Playing on wifi is a crime against yourself, your teammates and humanity.
Just some reskins of base set heroes I believe. The Soldier is a reskin of Commando if I recall correctly, so it’s neat for the infinite minigun build. Nothing of note though
As a chamber player I am glad to see his kit being mentioned in your post.

there’s almost always at least one player that doesn’t comm, hell in lower ranks most people don’t. i’m in diamond and i’d say usually 3 people are actually talking. in much higher ranks it’s a requirement, yeah, but cross that bridge when you get there lol
Doesn’t matter game mode really, but it genuinely happens every day. Not every game, but every day.
kernel access is always going to be invasive. you just kinda gotta deal with it. anyway it's less spyware than any other social media app ppl use, e.g. youtube probably steals more data than vanguard.
My bad
I would say you need a little more.
Literally 6 aces in a row everybody was playing like dog i felt nothing empty
Add me, I shall craft them for you. Epic is ⚡️ElectriCole⚡️
I can't remember the last night market that had a skin I'd use, even if they were all free and in my inventory. Just a hard pass on everything they offer every time.
Outside of her nade being pretty worthless and the sensors having their inconsistencies, her wall and ult can actually be pretty strong if used well.

I'd recommend checking out Boni on youtube, he's pretty good at explaining his strategies with her at high ranks and how he can use some of her weaker util effectively. You can also watch Keeoh's Deadlock speedrun to immortal. He relies more on his game sense and aim over her abilities pretty often but there's a few tricks you can pick up on there.

Other than that, just find what works well for you as you play and hope riot gives her a buff soon.

You will need to seek the answers.  I have provided you the questions you need to ask yourself.  But you need a daily routine and dedicated practice and warm-up.

But I'll say 400 edpi is high for me.  You want precision and crosshair placement if you're focusing on aim.  

If you're that easily tilted maybe this game isn't for you?  What are your motivations to be better or rank up?

Bro too relatable
It doesn't fix smurfing to allow 5 stacks never said it did.

Disallowing 5 stacks with large skill gaps significantly worsen the smurfing problem.

They tried to disallow it and at least they weren't blind and they realized how insane their mistake was and rolledback asap.

Valorant was my first Tac fps and I solo queued to Asc 2 in about 1000 hours. I jumped up to ascendant from Plat after a hardware upgrade. Your playtime seems to line up with mine but it’s more correlative than an precise relationship.
This is super helpful thanks dude. So next question. Lets say I’m playing astra and I have my star set up of smoke + suck down on the exit to b site from boat house —hope I’m getting the names right. I hear them rushing and I’m alone, without teammates nearby. Do i still pop the smoke + suck  to stall out as I retreat for the retake or should I just pick my stars up and save my cooldowns?
I just did, it won’t help though.

I told them in the ticket that i don’t need to be unbanned, but just tell me what software got me banned so i can delete it for in the future.

I got a reply telling me: we will check if the ban was justified, if it wasn’t we will unban you, if it was you won’t get back to you.
combine them both.
ACS itself isnt taken into effect. Its called Encounter MMR and is visualized by the stars in the performance report.

Essentially if you outperform specific players that you shouldnt, you recieve extra points.

Current visual bug, doesn't affect wall health. You can fix it with view distance I think maybe? tbh I don't mind as I can sneak a peek through my walls.
So, I’m a sentinel main, I’ve reached immortal on sentinel and I’ve also reached immortal on duelist only 🤷🏻‍♀️ my suggestion to you is that recognition is the first step. People are in the ranks they are for a reason. Sean Gares, Sideshow, anyone who analyzes is great to watch to understand the game more, and woohoojin has guides for aim. I never struggled with aim as my main issue through out the game but there are plenty of guides if you don’t feel confident running duelist. 

But if you really want to get out of plat and climb I’d suggest locking in duelist, and ignoring what others are doing. I have reached like I said both ways and I think duelist is far far easier to achieve to climb higher, faster. 

Play smart, have fun, and have a good mental. People who flame their team or they talk in the mic all the time and tell the team what to do won’t help/people are less inclined to listen. I mute people who tell me how to play. No one is going your smokes down properly if you’re back-seating them. If you see it, try and adjusts and figure out ways to find kills instead of executing on site immediately.
Superchargers are for levels past 130....
Thanks a lot, i tried this and it seems to have worked.
Of course we hate this game but play it all the time
I love the bass boosted shooting sound of 2023 vandal imo
Hero loadouts and traps shine more than weapons this ventures season
Nice clip !! My aim is also ass . But I think aim doesn't matter much , u can have good aim but still stuck in low elo. Gamesense should be NO.1 priority after Gold in my opinion .I have prioritised my gamesense more and almost reached ascendant. At least my case is like this only . Aim is decent but gamesense is not immo level .
If you don’t contribute enough to the mission, you won’t get rewards. You should also be helping your teammates by building. Do not let all your other teammates build the defensives.
Raze probably since you get obliterated by paint.
Hard pass.  The best value skins are those in the 7100 range.
Most average CaseOh stream
They will, but if epic finds out they will ban the account.
do you care about being the highest ranked?

Would you rather have someone pick smokes, smoke the entrances and have their smokes leak out by meters or have a duelist main carry the team
Can you lean into it? Say something at the start "Hey everyone, I know my voice is high-pitched but I'm not trolling, I just wanna play the game so please don't sass my for it. " Then follow up with comms regarding the gameplay or something. No idea if this will work, but I've tried something similar when I play with my mum (she's 72 and not amazing at the game, so when she's last person standing or a teammate starts to say something about her slow reaction time, I immediately pipe up with "hey look this is my mum and she's 72, please don't be mean to her she's trying her best, this is why we are in unrated"). Usually folks who had started to spout toxic flames change their tunes immediately "Oh FR! Hey mum! You're doing great!"
Pro play is NOT indicative of whether an agent is good or bad. It can cue us into some good strats, but it isn’t the only factor. Yoru has huge impact when played correctly, but you actually have to play him correctly for him to work.

Bro, I’m not saying to remove the mobility. I actually like the mobility I don’t mind the mobility. My problem is the combo of the double satchel and the combo of up draft and dash to take a boatload of free space because there’s very little consequence for using those abilities. No other agent out there can negate a chyper trap or a sage wall or a deadlock wall like jet and
 Raze can. To me that is a problem when to do list agents can single-handedly negate a site set up when no other dualist has ability to do that. I think that they could even do this and give her smokes a buff and also I’d be fine with removing the ability press for the dash. I honestly wouldn’t even care if they added back another up draft I just don’t like the ability of being able to get through utility for free essentially.
If you really want to hit bronze or even gold etc, just spend 1-2weeks practicing your aim and movement, and learning the very basics of the game. People spend hours and hours in comp and complaining about their rank when the issues they have are much faster and easier fixed in range and understanding the game. Also watch VODs. I didn’t believe for a long time how much worse some of my decisions or gameplays were before I started watching vods and actively fixing them. That helped me and still helps me improve every time I play 

If you prefer to learn by just playing then expect it to be slower and try to actively think mid and after games on how to improve.
Ye I heard there were issues with ff and remake so they left it out. It's the beta after all
If you want some words of advice don't overanalyze single matches. Like 99% of players have a 45-55% win rate. You'll lose games you could've won, you win games you should've lose. With a performance like this you'll still end up with positive RR after 1W-1L, if you play like crazy you can still end up positive after 1W-2L

Just focus on correcting your mistakes (no matter how minor they are), and don't forget to first and foremost have fun playing this game :)
My twine base has definitely hit the build limit. The trick is to place the traps after you finish building the structures.
Bro just cook and make them feel bad for getting outperformed by a “10yr old” they are usually just brain rot players anyways
If you've gotten it to OT, there's always hope. Drawing is such a loser mentality.

No. You could sell the default stars that you get.

For me the definition of Hard-Stuck is that you are at the Rank you deserve, hence why you are stuck. 

If you are truly better than the rank ur at, you are only gonna stay there for a week or two. 

In iron i didnt even know what the objective of the game was tbh...
if they still suck after playing so long it's kinda their fault. you can play unrated together and try to have fun but ranked is out unless you smurf. i respect your decision not to. they should respect it too. you don't bring your "pro" soccer player in your freetime club either.

I think the system needed changes, but it was already confusing to new players before. Adding a new point / bonus system is not a good solution. I think a much more simplified, streamlined system would be better for player experience. There are literally 5 point pools (AP, XP, VP, Radianite, and now KP.) There's no way to make that work without it being confusing, especially when so many of them overlap in their uses. So I that KP only make sense if we can ditch some of the others.
Yeah I do it as a joke in that “sMoKeS?!?!” mocking voice. Then if nobody wants to play smokes I just say “it’s okay, I’m playing Jett we have smokes anyway.”
bad sarcasm tbh
If your aim is half good, try Chamber. He's not as good as Cypher or Killjoy when it comes to holding a site on his own, but he's a really fun Agent
It’s more an annoyance than hurtful, it’s just that those games usually drag on forever in my experience. We were in like 15/15 overtime and drawed, was a horrible experience and all for no credit
same for me
I tried organizing an effort for valorant on r/place but no one joined D:

Eh I think a lot of people just play auto pilot. Everytime I call people to break the wall, they will and I’m in gold.  Agreed it’s best to break it and then just reset — makes people second guess if we’re actually going mid, faking mid, or just rehitting mid later. I don’t agree with folks who think their team is at fault. 

If you’re not asking for it or doing it yourself, that’s on you.
this cypher needs to be comm banned
Just based on [tracker.gg](http://tracker.gg), seems like you carry your games while playing initiator/duelist, and losing while playing sentinel. Just start locking those 2 roles and you will be fine.

Deathmatch is very useful. I used to be bronze 1 and by playing deathmatch twice a day I shot up to  diamond in less than 2 acts. It helped me a lot with crosshair placement.
Did you read the title? It's for console and before you ask, no there isn't cross play and yes your account works across the 2 platforms so you keep your skins.
Some people bind Jett dash or Raze satchel to MB5 so they have full movement capabilities while using their abilities. Q to ping danger is just silly though

I am back to playing chamber in ranked more (D2 peak) and think he is still pretty good. His op is an op, his HH is still pretty good and nice eco option and can swing low buy rounds. And his trip is pretty good if he is anchoring. It’s large enough to cover most chokes and at the very least can distract while you shoot. I think his TP isn’t great but you just have to be creative to use it well. I have been having great success with him on maps like sunset, breeze, haven, and ascent. I like that he can shut chokes down with his trip and I’m not distracted by other sentinel util and trying to use it properly.
You putting hate in a hole country I don't think you'd want to hear something like that bout you country, my guy

They capitalized on the fact BR games were super popular and made a BR mode last minute which took off. They didn’t need STW to exist at all as long as they built BR from scratch, has nothing to do with funding
watch what you say boy.
it used to be allowed, but you would usually end up with 4 people all queued together flaming the one soloq guy and we’ll just say that was a less then desirable experience
Nice clip but oh my god why is brimstone looking at a sage wall XD
Okay it seems like you have a wide variety of characters that you play. Don’t worry that’s really good and you’re going to need that later in your journey. Right now though I’d suggest picking one agent (your favorite/best), and really just try to learn it. After you’ve fully learned it you’ll def be ranked up Atleast 1-2 ranks. I don’t know how good your mechanics are, but I have a couple tips for that too. For starters, swing and peak every angle ready to take a fight. That means just mentally preparing for a fight prior to swinging and also making sure your mouse is in a comfortable position.
bind and split are so bad
 Helps getting the pacing of shots down.
Higher ping makes for a bigger peeker's advantage, but at 40-50 I don't think it would be noticeable
Same. Damn

Flinger gonna fling
If you know/think/notice someone is playing around a specific spot or corner. Throw some flash/dmg ability/intel ability/smoke into it.

The amount of low rank players I see playing something like skye and dying post plant with full util is way too high.
it's how people make it through all the waves.... it became manditory for the old 30 wave frostnites
You can see the ranks in Unrated games too though.
I suck at the game, so no, its not
Based on crosshair placement/movement I would guess somewhere between gold and low plat.
I don’t like it, but all the super jumps to see over the map as Jett require two updrafts.
Because if you're in a server with under 18's and you're over 21, you should reevaluate your life choices.
IP change is even easier and free.
I generally watch what is happening on the map in downtime, and lets use ascent for an example. It'll bee a push on B Main, I kill one, smokes go down, opposing team will rotate immediately. They will push A, and catch one of my teammates grossly out of position at A Main Arch, kill them, rush the site, kill the other. 5v4/3 turned into a now 4v4 or 3v3 the rest of us rotate over after spike has been planted, and now we're in post plant with the attackers. The teammates will stay in passive positions (i.e. heaven) as I move forward on A Main because we've already determined no one is hell, not even make an attempt to begin moving forward onto site till I either kill one, or die. I've been up to diamond 1 solo-queue like a year ago, and then stopped playing for a while because work got too busy. Came back a month ago or so, and ended up in gold. What I notice in gold is that people move too slowly. Everyone either tries to hold an angle too long, or shift walks everything, or lazy peaks, or will literally see a person on the screen (sometimes in crosshair sometimes in peripheral) for a good while and not even react. I try to take advantage of the fact that if I am seeing my teammates do such stupid shit, why wouldn't the enemy be doing the exact same thing? I just cannot contain the choices my teammates make. If I play directly with a teammate, they wont move forward till I do, then they never trade.
Average jonas take lessons from him
honestly these cases are so fucking wild that they become good experiences to look back on and laugh, but terribly annoying during the experience there will always be someone who hates you eventually in solo queue
Your 100% gonna run into toxic teammates but that’s what the mute and report buttons are for.

I’d say play a ranked game or two. If you get lost in the sauce then play unrated games until you feel you’ve improved enough.
How long? My guess is if you’re inconsistent and panic you either care about your rank or you’re not confident enough. Quit doubting yourself
A remake should be ***automatic.*** There shouldn't be a vote to begin with.
Why do I find it difficult to level up in Ventures? I hardly play it but when I did I felt like it took forever to level up.
Honestly, I like smokes. People say they're boring but you can do a lot of cool things with them. Like Astra on Lotus, when you place the star near A Rubble and then recall it to play mind games on the enemy. Or when you fake a site using a smoke and 2 people. I like strategizing different ways to use my smokes and how I can use them to my advantage. Although I'm only in Silver-Gold elo.
>Hey I am not getting any rank buddies from quite sometime, I realized this yesterday, any thoughts about the reason here
Brb gonna kill myself
>Yes, but arc jess support is already a necessary for farming builds so why buff that further?  
>  
>It's not gonna effect use rates or anything

because as you shown her in lead isn't better than southie

sure she could be a nice support hero but use one trick pony logic because she is a OTP in STW because she can only farm and even then she is worse in both lead and support than southie

and i didn't mention clip which dwarfs both because clip naturally gives you more value per AMC
You’re obviously doing something that VALORANT thinks is good and worthy of being out of Iron. Most likely it’s something outside kills- if you really are dedicated to the grind, i recommend something as simple as going on tracker and looking at your tracker score per game lost and won. You’d be shocked what you can glean from that.

The focus/ads also lessens the bloom on continuous fire and aids with controlling recoil. Its a lot more than just "zooming in" as its a lot harder to hit those instant headshots while moving solely because of the bloom/recoil mechanics.

But I get what you mean, I dont play cs much but I play games like overwatch where aiming is only specific to widow/Ashe so I too have a habit of not using the focus/ads much

This just says Esports gg "expects" it to be back my june 9th. Based on what?? its june 9th now lmfaoo. Great source tho man, for sure.
The second to last is probably a 2
Shit I meant right click of course lol. I'll leave it up and own the mistake.
immortal is roughly masters

grandmaster is actually the league equivalent of radiant, because gm is 500+ while chal is 300
Hey, thanks. CoolCritterQuack in the comments mentioned that limiting frame rate increases input lag. Does this not happen with Nvidia limiter?
Take that shit in stride, rank doesn't matter, it's just a skin for your mmr. You're gonna get games you just can't win, just like how you get games you simply can't lose. Toxic people are gonna happen, bad days are gonna happen. gg wp go next love thy neighbor.

ACS IS used to a certain degree I just used it more as a vague way of explaining that they should reward players more since it might be confusing to understand otherwise but some of the points I mentioned should increase combat score where as some should just slightly increase however the hidden mmr views your performance

'the performance MMR system already tracks encounters' - I'm already aware of then hence why I mentioned combat score as that correlates with it and is easier to understand over saying 'encounter rating' or something like that

'Allowing players to choose who gets MVP seems much more superficial than having a proper metric (and can be abused by stacks)' - I mentioned queued plays not being allowed to do this with one another

'rewarding players for how long they survive in a round just rewards AFKs and those who sit back with little impact in a round' - this is a very good point and something I didnt explain correctly but I meant more so on defense side but even so your arguement is very good and that probably isn't a great idea to implement
i play Viper in not ranked games cos i find her sexy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ just play whoever you want tbh it does not matter
thank you for the report! we have this on our list now too
Peak rank Plt 1 until that God Awful episode rest. Games seemed more balanced in those lobbies. RR was also more balanced. Now I’m like a yo-yo. S1 to S3 then back down to near B 3 then back to  my rank up to s3 then back down. I have realize Riot could care less about fixing and addressing the Elo problems and instead fix other dumb issues.
this guy is yapping there are 100% situations where smoking off your entrance makes sense. pretty common on c long haven, but it also makes sense in plenty of other places on many maps. its not common, but it can be a good play. entirely situational
So why are people getting banned for having tracker?
besides, that source is from your company itself not an official statement from riot.
isnt that a lil bais? is there a source directly from riot which supports the claim that tracker.gg in game overlay is not bannable?
Different emotes the first one is sharpshooter and the second one is finger guns
Nah if anything its gotten better. The level 20 to play competitive plus the improvement to the MMR formula have made smurfing a lot harder to maintain unless you are constantly purchasing new accounts or purposely throwing game after game. Also Riot doesn't give a fuck about smurfing and why should they? That is another account for someone to potentially buy expensive skins on which is a definite plus to a company trying to make money.
so we need to avoid that region right? 🤪

Now mine says update required but is still doesn’t pop up


> It’s still just as easy to sit in close range; Lamps on bind, Hookah on bind, Garage on Haven etc. Crouch in a corner, wait for enemy and you have at least one kill and maybe a gun upgrade. 

Nobody cares about this

> Meanwhile the Judge players that play aggro and get around with good movement, have been punished. 

This is what everyone was complaining about
On a round with an OP save.. perfect..

for a classic? just die.. you will get more econ to help your team
Same here. It's actually unplayable. My first cue that there's a skye ult activated is hearing the cabbages. I tap spike, sova pops ult, i have no fucking clue and i have no time to dodge the first shot.
i got accused of trolling after WINNING pistol buying hvy armor and spectre. we lost.

holy fuck the stupidness in this game is just astonishing in metall ranks.

Yeah, it should already be in the shop. It's completely random so just check every day to see what 4 skins you got for the day.
Lol same. It's really that simple. I'm coming on val to improve and have fun, not to deal with toxic immaturity so I'll usually assess the lobby first before I say anything. 
Or if I'm try-harding I might comm regardless of my team but I don't always have the energy/am in the mood for that. 

Every team has to deal with teammates who don't comm, or bad teammates/disruptive teammates etc. So there's no point being mad with people who don't talk as if they're stopping you climbing because they're not.

If you want people to talk more than if you are pleasant and talk yourself, you're likely to get your team talking which will help you win games.
Rotating barrell was just cherry on cake.
Its not any different than the stock version, people buy the stw packs for skins & vbucks (rarely for stw), and stw packs have never really been about STW characters. 

All of which you said otherwise. So again, bullshit.

Keep in mind I haven't watched any of his videos yet. 

The only tracker I could find of him is privated, he doesn't have anything in his profile about his experience in the game, or even what rank he is. Doesn't mean he's a bad coach, but I simply won't waste my time on his videos since he hasn't shown why I should trust him. There's a million other self proclaimed coaches out there just like him, and unfortunately the majority of them are shite.
If you have trouble learning something in that situation, then smurfing isn't the issue.  


You'll have that same problem no matter if you're facing a smurf or if you're facing someone who's simply better than you but is your rank.  


Competitive is all about getting better and grinding it out. If you aren't able to get better and learn from your mistakes, but then complain about smurfs, just play unranked at that point. At least then, you'll still have skill-based matchmaking with MMR. And then you won't have to worry about de-ranking because someone was miles better than you. Additionally, you then wouldn't have to worry about learning what you did wrong in a game.
diamond is when youre a bit above average but by no means high elo. mid to high ascendant is when youre pretty good but still not high elo. immortal and above is high elo with a lot of refinement left.
that’s not counting over heal, i gave u a direct quote from the article.

Viper ult can block flashes even before it is fully expanded. The same thing can happen with viper’s wall and orb. Pretty sure it isn’t intentional, but it’s been in the game for a while and hasn’t been fixed so idk.

Reverse finisher? 😂😂😂
I would usually only buy spectre if I won pistol, but recently been trying stinger instead

I feel like close range its better, and "long"(dont take long range fights but medium range ig) the stinger ads is more accurate than spectre and the burst is pretty nice
Im enjoying this game a lot. Got it on both systems. First time playing since i dont have a pc. But damn this game is hard as hell to shoot. Usually i get frustrated and stop playing but i cant stop playing this game. I just wish i can shoot better
Can someone gift me Electro Swing in Fortnite? My user is amadeus0909m. It's one of my favorites emotes but i am kinda low on money this month and i can't afford it.

hahahahahaha please do not recommend one of the worst lowest pick rate agents. that is for a reason the community has spoken. kay0 is trash your knife has to land on them and not get shot (it takes FOREVER to detonate and i immediately shoot 90% of kay0 knives immediately) and even then it gives you like 8 seconds to push. meanwhile cypher can literally play any distance away from his util and its still fully effective

Completely agree! Best game ever :))
As Iso you should be pretty confident to swing the first angles, you should communicate with your initiators to flash or something like that too so that it's a better chance to win the fight, it'll give you a lot more confidence. You should be swinging as the duelist regardless so that even if you die, the rest of your team are in positions to trade you (granted you are communicating)

I play a lot of Clove and i'm usually the one trading or being traded, having the overheal is enough for me to be confident to swing and keep swinging after the initial frag, it's similar to Iso so just have some confidence, and take your time to lineup the shot.
I had our brim use his ult near mid so it looked like they were committing the other site. 

We walked into the re hit for free 😎

Cause who commits an ult randomly and not commit to that site?
Best of luck! If you ever want specific Brim tips or lineups, let me know I can even show you in game.
What if they removed heal from being a base ability (leave it in her ult) and replace it with an ability that reveals the closest enemy (still needing an orb)?  So she can still escape from a bad situation, and can provide some info (more useful for team than current kit) but can't just chain kills for free while keeping full health.

You dont need an extra mode, just let us play 10vs10 on the existing maps. Iam not talking about competitive, just let people choose FFS.

In old shooters you always could choose which map and with how many people. Why are games in this regard today so backwards, I dont get it.
I love knit picking and as a designer myself, this is kinda geeking out for me too. Buckle up!!!

In my opinion, they wanted this screen to be confusing. Let me explain because actually this is fun.

1- I think they are trying to not point out who had a shitty game while highlighting the best player without ranking them from good to bad. If someone really wants that info, they will see it at the second screen anyways.

2-This way of composing these 5 illustration kinda gives the feeling of a "Team Photo", other than a top5 chart

3-If you are having trouble finding yourself at this screen, and let's say that you've bottom fragged, you will not take that much attention from other players. Toxicity protection, just a little bit.

4-Similar to the one above, you will not be toxic to yourself too much because this screen kinda feels random. You will not feel like you are the bad or the good part of the team, you are a member of this team.

5-If I was working for this, I would love to place the illustration of the mvp to center. Because the other options are placing the mvp above or to the left, which both causes trouble for placing the other 4 illustrations.

6-Hire me Riot, please.

Exactly
Yeah there are always going to be players that just clear stuff they honestly don’t need to be clearing lol. Happens to me all the time! Easier said than done, but a big part of the “lurk” role is to learn when the opposing team does and adjust. It takes patience, time, and serious commitment to memorize what teams are doing and how. 

This is a crude example but I played a game on Breeze recently where we were on defense and I was Viper. The attacking team after the first couple of rounds stopped pushing A (where I setup) cause it was causing them to loose early fights with mollies and all that. So when they started pushing B I started lurking. The first few rounds they wouldn’t trip A main with their Chamber, so easy flanks there. Eventually they started tripping A main, so the following round I setup on B, ran back to A and used my util to “show presence” which caused them to rotate right back to A. I didn’t push all the way to the trip, just far enough up in cave that I could get a couple of picks as they ran through thinking I was B. 

It doesn’t always work out that way. Sometimes they’ll just sprint through util like morons, but it’s important to always take what they give you and DO something with it. Not just passively continue the same smokes, tactics, lurks, etc.

Agreed - but I should have defined frequent—every couple of months, it acts up. There are long periods of no issues, which is glorious. Over the past 2 weeks, it's gone out twice. Brutal.
"Don't try that shit around here ^you ^^fackin ^^^cant"

it is due to other’s pc’s. if they have it on an ssd, how much ram they have, etc.
Lmao the comment right above yours say to look at the minimap.
Basically you have a low hidden mmr so the game wants to place you at the rank you "belong in"
I'm gonna defend my take. What is the idea of Reyna. Her util can't be used for anyone but herself. Every other duelist has at least one util that can be used for the team. And from what I've heard she becomes less and less useful in high rank. Which I assume is because people one tap more often. And yes it's one hundred percent that she's a Smurf agent.
Also I had other problems than just Gameplay.
he did actually see some experimentation but nothing that stuck
“Hi, yes, FBI? I think you should put someone on a watchlist…”
I haven’t had a ps4 for a couple years, but they have separate ps4 and ps5 versions of the game now. Maybe the 4 version is solved down a bit?
Tilde, i absolutely love the knife
Been playing since Beta. Phantom used to be cheaper. Can't remember the exact prices. But I'm 100% sure the Phantom used to be cheaper.
Wtf where is your crosshair
And if you used crosshair by mistake dont spam just aim and tap tap nothing more
Spam in close range only
not a big problem, it's just a culture  
most of time your team will have smurf and enemy team too

few reason that someone use smurf  
1 is they want to lower average party mmr, so match become easier and less sweat (because their friends suck)  
winning is fun and everyone love winning. this is major reason  
2 someone don't want to lose their solo queue elo, they just play smurf acc with friend and don't care  
3 it just boosting their friend, it's less important but some party did it and always happen

just 1-3 point mixed together, when enemy doing it,  your team do it too  
everyone just doing it and become a culture like normal thing  
it's like less than 10% that everyone played their main,   
some ppl even play smurf acc on solo queue or duo with friend just for fun  
game will never balanced but it's not important imo  
ppl just play 5 stacks comp to have fun with friends

carry noob friend is less effective than just let smurf played their acc  
but someone want to get that rank while still feel legit by get carried which idk

it just good to know that enemy could have better skill like 1-2 full rank than solo lobby  
as well as better coordinated at higher rank
Yoru solos whole jjk
I don’t know who was playing who
i'm well aware of it.. but that is simply the simpliest math.. and does fit real world results... that's the problem.... the DPS value is functionally useless, specially for the likes of bows.. but pretty much every weapon including malee...

It assumes 100% accuracy, no accounting for any variables at all... which there are plenty...
 Of course not! You don't need high Hz to climb ranks. It's all about skill and strategy, not how many Hz your monitor has.
You can almost do it in the range. Activate the bot next to the big target. Ping the ground right below the bot's head.

If you shoot straight through the thick wall that is right in front of the bot, you should do about 92 damage with a headshot. If you go to the other half of the gate and shoot diagonally through that wall, you have a lot more concrete to go through, and after some tries I managed to get a 46 damage headshot. Not quite 31, but I think it might not quite be possible here because that broken brick wall prevents you from taking an even more disadvantageous angle.

In theory, any solid block of concrete with a very open corner should do, like on Ascent in B lobby the corner of the building with the big octopus on it, or the one that leads to tiles. But I can't test it myself on account of not having any friends.
Not really, headshot doesnt and shouldnt have any correlation to mmr, except through kills. Higher hs might result in more kills, but doesnt mean you will have more kills. (I had researched quite a lot in mmr, and i know some stuff that affects and some that doesnt)

I never understand people that get stressed in an ranked situation. You can't win every game and you will preform worse when you scared of everything or you playing with the mind "Everyone is better than me". 

I just play since 1 month and I choose to be a controller mainly Astra. I notice that people in lower ranks (Iron-Silver) are hilarious scared for gunfights. When a side is getting pushed the didn't look at the smoke I placed they instead run away and drop the side for free. With this attitude they will never improve in gunfights.   
I'm new to the game and already need to do everything on my own, because my team shit their pants as soon there is a enemy around. 

Just drop this fear and take your fights with confidence. Don't think "He is better then me and I will die" instead think "I will kill this bastard" swing it and do it.   
I improved in this 1 month so much already. Because I have no fear and I know I'm good at gaming. As soon I get the mechanics down and learn the tactics behind the game I will climb up the ladder. I found some people to play with and I already overcome some of them, that play this game for years now. 

  
I had the same situation in Apex Legends. Two of my friends played this games for years already and was scared of every single fight. I was new in the game and because of that I wanted to take EVERY possible fight. Otherwise I can't improve in shooting people. It took me 2 months to get better than both of my friends that played it for years. The main difference again, they were scared and I'm not.
Duellist
Raze... 

Those damn sachels are a mystery to me. I've played Junkrat sometimes in Overwatch, but those sachels don't seem to activate in the same way, even though they do pretty much the same as his mines. 

How tf do those sachels work?! 🤔
If you’re under ascendant, comms are NOT the reason you’re losing games lol
I think you're missing the other part of their FOMO model. People also buy skins that they kinda want while they are waiting for their most-wanted skin. "Oh I really wanted glitchpop vandal but reaver is cool so I'll buy that for now, who knows how long until glitchpop shows up?"

If at any point Riot allowed players to guarantee a skin purchase, discounted or not, they would lose that aspect of FOMO (besides initial bundle releases). People would just know they can wait until the next Night Market or whatever event to get their most-wanted skin. There would be fewer instances of people buying more skins while they wait.

Essentially, Riot does so much research on what would make them more money. People on here make suggestions all the time that they think could be better for the players and Riot: lowering skin prices, having a guaranteed skin purchase, refunding skins, trading, etc. But if any of these actually made Riot more money, they would have done it already.

I mean hey I'd rather have a bottom fragger who can clutch 1v3s than a top fragger who can get 3 and then lose every 1v1 postplant. I myself am guilty of being unable to clutch for shit.
Why are you using Deadlock for flank trip when her sound-based nature doesn't lend itself well to it lol? She's a spike trapper; anyone who tries to plant or defuse will get stunned if you put the trip near the spike plant point.
it’s more of a “this isn’t the skin that i exactly wanted but it’s decent and i don’t know when i will see it in the shop again so i might as well buy it now” sort of mentality, and i’m guilty of following this mentality as well so it works out in riots favor more than just letting people buy only the skins they wanted whenever they want
Normally I’d agree, but on the day I posted this, I just had several games in a row where it was the same story and I was losing my marbles
People constantly talk english on french servers, french and others alike.
There's nobody tackling down those that don't talk French, and that would be dumb anyway, so why can't the opposite be truc too ?

Europe is composed of a plurality of cultures and language and recognizing that is simple maturity.

Now, that said, I often see 2 things:

_ A french is talking for whatever reason, others recognize his accent and they instantly become toxic.

_A French recognize an other one and eventually start talking with him in the language they're most acustomed with and others become toxic.

Now I hear you, you wanna say French are toxic, blablabla, well in your next game with one, try to see if there's not someone jumping on him instantly when he talk (or tries to, since it's not mandatory to learn it perfectly either).

I Can assure you that the "French bashing" that began with american conservatives after the invasion of Irak is still there and hearing it for no reason will obviously hit a nerve sometimes.

Initially I didn’t talk because I didn’t have a microphone, also because of my anxiety. Apex Legends was my first pc game/fps and it had a great ping system so I was more inclined on using Valorant’s ping system and such to compensate. If you give a callout in game I’ll most likely listen to it, the agents auto-callouts are also helpful cues as well if you pay attention to them.
something stupid made up by kids to scam other mids
Apparently she did, from 15 to 13 seconds but apparently wall goes up faster
In these cases, the emotional reason is they are hardstuck on PC and came over to console to get some kind of validation from shitting on a bunch of level 1s lol.

This game (like any other comp game) is full of weirdos, just mute them and play. Riot is also pretty good about punishing toxic behavior so report them if they’re saying truly awful stuff.
There are builds that let you AFK the UFO wave - the secret seems to be to not build anything which has more than 3 tiles in the main husk path, but to create lots of sacrificial 3x3 builds out round the edges of the amp area to draw the UFOs away. That said, I have not attempted it myself (Canny gives better rewards and just works).

It’s a lot of long range gunfights.

Now, of course many maps have long range gun fight areas. But Breeze is almost ENTIRELY long range gun fights. Holding B is long range, holding A is long range, Both Mid from doors and mid from spawn is long range. The only real short range area on the entire map is the hallway connecting Attacker’s B entrance to mid. And even then, defenders aren’t going in there most of the time, if at all.

I’d argue the map is the biggest in the game (If not, then it’s probably fracture). There’s just an incredible amount of open space.

Some people find it funny when others are mad at them, or they're just trying to derank to smurf.
Any non penetrating weapon spamming on metal causes this, like stinger with inf ammo
All three
I'm same low elo as you (peak S1), let me tell you something 😂, when I play good and we lose I lost as litlle as 3RR, and when I play good I earn even 35RR.

So if you really play good you'll have positive RR in no time. Problem is I alo lose games I shouldn't lose losing 30RR on occasion or winning just 10RR due to me have very litlle with win...

So it's all about you...

Lmao and here I am with 3 reaver skins including operator
Yeah it's gonna take you 2 ventures seasons to get those🙄
Can confirm, have seen this happening a little in normal missions, too. ATLAS damaged but all walls intact.
Cypher is still a better anchor even after that tho. Cypher trips counters jett significantly(jett has a high pick rate). if you know how a jett plays, you are almost guaranteed to catch her if she plays the default dashes. If you dont catch her, then you are catching her follow up. The fact that cypher highlights whoever he catches makes it so op. It synergizes with the smoke screen so well. Its a free kill. You force the enemies to wrap around your site or invest a lot of utilities to force their entry. The latter makes retake easier. Deadlock on the other hand doesnt counter duelists that has a movement skill. The sensor is so huge and loud, it gets destroyed before it can even activate. The only place i think its viable are places where you are forced to drop and make a noise, like fracture drop, b ascent, hookah bind. Cyphers ult is also op for requiring just six orbs. When used properly, you are always ahead to counter the enemy play.
No value at all. Buying, selling, or otherwise transferring account from one person to another is a violation of the ToS and 9 times out of 10 just results in the account getting banned.

I can't do everything you should be executed
Yesssss
Shotguns exist for a reason. Proper use requires great sense of timing and awareness. 

Choosing to pick up a shotgun is a playstyle choice. It’s like throwing a high tripwire for a Jett that’s been updraft dashing into site. Your playstyle should adjust to how your enemies are playing and picking up a shotgun is one such choice.
It's all about how you use dm. Dm gives a lot of engaments in a short time. That's what you will miss in spike rush. And you should dm like its a ranked match. Meaning slowly and methodical clear all the angles in the correct way. Don't run around going for kills. If you constantly do that you will see yourself being more comfortable with your crosshair placement and gunfights.

My English very bad please excuse me
I love her too, unfortunately, her power level, while limited as a solo controller, when played alongside another controller (Omen, Astra, Clove) suddenly becomes ridiculously versatile. 

I've even seen pro teams play Viper on Ascent recently. *ASCENT*. The map with no long sightlines and predictable choke points!
I've played on NA servers with friends and the toxicity for running with pride flags was INSANE compared to when I've played on EU servers
Oh wait when I turn on agent based comparison movement goes to 50 thank god
Worst part is when u try to surrender instead of wasting time there's usually someone who's dead set on fighting it till the end even when the team doesnt stand a chance
So. For ISO. If you play against him. You can shoot his orbs. He'll be completely bummed out because you can kill him and deny his shield then type "No orbs?"  or "No shield?"
It is tho, because it’s been clearly stated many times before that gliders can’t be used in stw mode (clearly indicating it is entirely it’s own separate game mode)
That was my teammate who said that, I was trying to flank the guys pushing B.
I'm getting down voted for speaking the truth people, some people in this subreddit are clearly delusional in thinking STW gets updates and communication all the the time which is not true
jett +Reyna Get in and vamp kills.
Personally I’d rather have a one trick omen be a one trick kayo. This is mostly because snakes have much more impact on macro wise.
Doesn't help the map is pretty badly designed imo, so much unnecessary fat on the map that could easily be trimmed. Respect if you enjoy it, I personally do not.
Yes its technically a bit better. You will probably not notice any difference but there is no downside if you adjust the OS and in-Game sens accordingly, so why not.
How? I'd have to completely disagree on that. Valorant is more focused on core gunplay, abilities only help gain an advantage not much kills. 

In overwatch some abilities can literally one shot the whole team, while some abilities can save the whole team from dying. Team composition and timing of abilities is really crucial there. 

They're different games tho but I'm just saying the lack of voicelines, emotes, mvp highlights, replay system etc all seem lazy af to me. Atleast they could give us some cool agent skins bc their gun skins are really good and ik they're capable of being creative
I know this isn't the main problem, and I would love to make her more than marginally better. This is just a QoL request because its obnoxious that Cypher can move his trips mid-game but I can't.

Yeah I would recommend the same. The banana man makes some great videos and Asuna tore it up in that game. Kay/O is a hard agent to get good with imo because his util is difficult to get a ton of value out of, especially for a new player.
Actually it would just be her old kit like her old old kit
I had the typical instance where I was frustrated at a teammate who was flaming us for his own mistakes. One time he jumped out of bind hookah through a smoke no warning and died without saying from where and got mad at me for not trading. Assuming my mic was off I was telling my brother about this and realized my mic was on, I didn’t really find it embarrassing because I was right, higher frag than him, and cause he was being an asshole anyway. He tried to argue back but then the rest of the team chimed in that he has been doing this all game and I figured he would just be toxic the rest of the game as you’d expect, but instead whenever he would say anything the rest of the game he sounded really sad. As much as I wanted to feel bad, I didn’t really care cause of the things he said earlier were way meaner than anything I’ve ever said even with my mic off

I bought an Optiplex 5050 for $108 on Amazon. It runs stw at 30fps on low settings fine. 
I use it in another room when I really want to play and it’s easier building with mnk vs controlller for me.
Well take cypher for example again, would you throw floor trips against raze or crouching head height ones? Would you throw standing head height trips against fade dog or crouching head height ones? 

Still not convinced that having a player or two pick up a shotgun isn’t inherently a positive EV thing when playing against an ISO.
Thought so, cheers for confirming
I pick Yoru when someone does that. Otherwise I am a breach/Skye/omen player.
It’s still worth it for me to play, if it’s not worth it for you then don’t, simple as that
Nope also waiting
Champions Katana would be sick
That's incredibly fun
Don't look at your phone between rounds, don't play more than 3-4 games at a time.  

losing focus 6-7 rounds in is kinda wild.  Give yourself things to do, try to track enemies, pay attention to what util gets used, how enemies like to rotate, how you can exploit them to win the round, etc.

Well said. There's a difference between helping someone and outright doing the work for them. I've lost count of the times when I've joined an SSD and there's nothing there but tier 1 wood walls and no traps, with the SSD owner expecting everyone else to carry them through. They are not going to learn anything from that, yet progress through the story to higher level zones where their ineptitude is going to jeopardise the mission.

Unfortunately, you gotta look at the population of people that are playing here and then it all makes sense.

Maybe you could contact people with cultural influence in the Valorant scene? Someone should really make the community aware on a broader scale.
Clove isn’t “broken” good that she needs an emergency nerf, she’s new so people are finding nee ways to play her so she’s unpredictably good sometimes.
Yes, check other reply for explanation on why this is bad
The win rate is closer to 50% the more an agent is played because both sides can pick the same agents. But other than that it's a valid stat no?
Whats that ?
It’s a new episode not just new act. Ranks are gonna be weird sometimes you play vs bots and sometimes the best of the best. I was in ascendant before the reset and now I’m hard stuck diamond some games are super easy and some games are vs ex radiants/immortals ranked will be better in act 2
How come Ult didn't kill her for you?
Something that helped when I used to practice: Buy a sheriff and go into a DM. Take your time when aiming and try to make sure your first bullet hits the enemy. If you miss, punish yourself by letting them kill you or something. Once you get comfortable hitting your first bullet, move onto doing the same thing but for headshots. This requires a lot of patience but I guarantee it will improve your first bullet accuracy and overall aim
frankly, i don’t know how to say this nicely but there’s so much wrong with what you said that i’m genuinely struggling to believe that you believe what you’re saying. everything you just said absolutely reeks of delusion and either you aren’t willing to think about how your playstyle may or may not be dependent on your teammates, or you’re incapable of it altogether. no real point for me putting any thought into responding when you seem so unresponsive to it yourself
If you had a pistol and you pick up your dead teammates gun then no unless there is a good reason to do so. The op is very expensive so by picking it up you’re basically saving money. However not everyone wants to play with it so if someone wants it you should pick it up and give it to them

What's ur account user
they are not the same.
I don't understand why people do this. Someone has to bottomfrag that's just how that goes? Sometimes people bottomfrag but are helping the team in other ways. People who complain about bottomfraggers just don't have anything better to do. I usually just mute them, they're not worth the effort in my opinion
Bro is pro at dying
How would they tell if they're a smurf? How does any system know if there's a smurf? I'm not quite well versed about it
It will take at least a few months, probably more to get all of them
The problem is you feel the need to entry for your team when you don’t have the util to do so while you might have the skill. Honestly when I play off duelist I like to wait for my team, I’ll even let time run out before I go initiate with no util that can help us get on site
Yeah bro I know they’re downvoting you but it’s gotta be because they’re coping. They can’t really think the crosshair is gonna make them better lmfao

I'm gonna tell you exactly what you don't want to hear, and that is that you're coping, big time.


Your deathmatch and range performance going up is nice, and you shouldn't stop practicing those things, but those skills don't really transfer 1:1 to ranked since the vast majority of players do not play the same way in ranked as they do in DM. Additionally, mechanics are only one aspect of playing the game, and getting marginally better mechanically doesn't mean you're suddenly going to jump up ranks. I can also promise you that if you're stuck in low gold, you don't exactly have great mechanics, they are more than likely just...fine.


I am certain that if you posted a VoD, I would see you dry peeking all the time and constantly taking bad fights. After all, that playstyle used to work for you when you were better than your opponents mechanically, and your ego still tells you that you're better. Every player will reach a soft cap mechanically where they are no longer so much better than their opponents that they can take 50/50 or 40/60 fights and come out on top most of the time, and it sounds like you've found yours somewhere around mid gold. If you're getting one tapped all the time and feel like there's nothing you can do, that tells me that you're either swinging into people's crosshairs dry all the time, or playing common spots and getting pre-aimed all the time, both of which have little to do with mechanics.


Add in to that the fact that you're probably in your own head and tilted because, to you, you don't deserve to be gold and are way better than anyone else in your lobbies, you're just getting unlucky.  That just makes you play worse, which makes you more tilted, which makes you play worse, and the cycle continues.



My advice is to A. drop the ego and accept that mechanics aren't everything, and just because you do ok in your DMs doesn't mean you just deserve to top frag your ranked lobbies, and B. take a break from the game for a few days to try and reset your mental.
Never played ranked so far, so I can't tell you my rank but with bots my highest was 29, but my avg is about 18.

That’s alright, there is always room to learn new things. it’s good info to have but it’s not relevant in valorant as it is in CS. 

In valorant you can see the enemy teams money at the start of the round so you already have a good idea of who has what armor wise. in CS you either have to guess or use your experience to figure it out so having an audio indicator when you shot someone in the face was helpful
well that's cool for you. Literally posted all the comp games from this act. Posted the link aswell. Literally shows nothing

im saying my pc runs fortnite like crap.  i run a core i5-3470... very similar to yours.  my ram is maxed... i have amd rx570 .  unlocked it can run at the lowest possible resolution, about 70fps but it still hitches and drops to lows of 30 in build fights. I downloaded all the textures and run SSD. Complex skins kill my fps and build battles with double and triple edits slow my pc to a crawl, and PS5's.... and to top it all i actually have ZERO ping. flat zero, but when i get reported for killing another streamer, the Anti-cheat gives me 500 ping.  do at least a ddr4 system.
I started a few weeks ago. My game sense while still not great is leagues above what it was day 1. I actually feel like I’m playing the game now rather than running around aimlessly. 

Just play more and you’ll learn. Play around with a few characters then choose one and commit for a while. Learn what that character wants to be doing by watching a tutorial or by watching someone play the character. Recently I’ve been watching some Val tournaments Ludwig has been in because I believe he plays in Plat/Diamond so it’s not so high level that what they’re doing is inapplicable in lower ranks.
Me personally man, I wouldn't take that
I never thought I’d see this comment on reddit..thank you
You mean step-broru
I have been waiting for that one too, but I picked up the melee as I just want the music. I might consider getting the gun but the finisher is cool but I won’t see it often.
Most pro’s retire by 30’s because it’s a pathetic way to live your life playing games 9 hours a day. Actual professions where reaction time is a matter of life and death like f1 racing and fighter pilots have their avg age much higher than esports. 27 and 40 respectively. You can maintain and even improve your reaction time well until you go senile by having a good diet, good sleep, exercising regularly and doing reaction time drills.
Icebox Pearl and fracture are my favorite map, I hate sunset this map as no soul, bind is boring and split is also boring af
There is no point, it's literally just gameplay purposes only. But the crates have what we called refined Radianite.

It's like gold in our world. Yeah we find chunks of it in the ground, but we need to clean it and melt them into bars to actually be usable.

It's a similar story with Radianite. It comes from the ground, so it could theoretically be anywhere even if there are no crates, because the crates are only there to store the stuff they've processed.

So even if there's no Radianite crates, and the whole abyss map isn't cannon, there could be Radianite in the ground hence why we plant spike on it.
nope
Youtube algorythm just started recommending me valorant videos a lot, I tried it, hated it, stopped again. I just dislike that I can be better mechanically, have better gamesense and experience, but someone else just has better aim, It's just not for me, though I found out I enjoy overwatch because of that, so there is that.
Yeahhhh I see that. I think people misunderstood my question as how to optimize this kind of play instead of what I meant which is how to do literally anything in that situation. Seems like the best answer is to fill the lurking role
Someone has a Beta key left dm me pls
You get one free unlock when you first get the game. I used mine on cypher. I believe my brother used his on killjoy
Yeah the auto remake is the only option really. 

My point is:

Paul hates Breeze. It only requires one vote to remake. Paul remakes and everyone gets into a new game. 

Now Paul gets into Bind. Paul hates Bind too. Paul remakes and then gets re-queued again. 

Now this can go on for a while until Paul gets into a map he likes. But you have to remember there's 10 Paul's every game each with different preference.
I think that wanting to play with friends is one of the few valid reasons for smurfing. Riot is not trying to incentivise players to keep grinding ranked, so this is directly a result of Riot's decision-making. However, it's still somewhat a gray-area in my opinion. 

You basically have enormous control over the outcome of the games. So, how do you determine who wins? Do you even have the right to decide? 

While I am of the belief that players who lose to a classic literally just need to "git gud", in terms of competitive integrity, it is still a relatively negative thing to be doing.

For Ascendant, I don't think you need to be restricting yourself. Players in Ascendant are typically hard-set on grinding and reaching Immo/Rad. If they can't handle immo/rad smurfs then how do they expect to reach that elo? As long as you're the only smurf, it means that 1 out of 5 enemies on the enemy team just has to lock-in and play as well as you are. I would not be giving them any chances.
No, chamber is not a based quebecker unfortunately
I want to see RIOT's reasoning. The [stats show shotguns suck](https://www.vstats.gg/weapons?rank=ALL), so Im surprised they are doing such a heavy nerf.
Yes but when you do that your basically allowing them to runover you.
If I play smokes and someone tells me to smoke that's fine and I'll do that but if someone who clearly didn't give a shit tell me to pick a certain character I won't.
I've played the game enough to understand instalockers exist and I also find it funny when they get mad when you don't pick the smoke or initiator they want.
There's a difference.
Expertly said
You can not abuse a reset as Riot detects mmr and won’t allow you to duo even after a reset. Another reason they are the best in the industry.
Wdym you’re 11? Like level 11? Never disclose your age on the internet if you’re underage. There are lots of creeps.
factually incorrect
Being able to redeploy her orb is the most engaging part of her kit, it's so cringe that they're completely taking that away. She's definitely going to be dogwater for retaking a site.

Nah just don’t instalock a duelist if you can’t kill
Wdym? Even as a gekko you need to have high number of assists and it's even more easier as a gekko.

Relateable, we embrace the rat playstyle
So I was that guy in unrated once, but to be fair I meant to queue for comp and was wondering why I was left clutching so many rounds and solo comming. I was upset when I hit the results screen and didn’t have a progression screen for rr.
Same thing happening in console version servers must have shut down
The overall skill of the community increases every day as more and more people get better at mechanics and fundamentals. Golds of today would have been diamonds in EP1 Act 1. If you want to climb higher than Gold, you must accept that you have to put more time in getting better at the game. 

There are definitely cheaters in Valorant, as well as smurfs, but if you get hung up on blaming smurfs or cheaters every game, you're not going to climbing at all. And 40 bombs are common because it is actually hilariously easy to rack up kills against enemy teams who have no comms and have no idea what they're doing. Players in Gold and below have terrible spacing, terrible util usage, don't know how to path in executes, etc. A player aware of their mistakes can punish them, even if they're the same rank.

Initial impressions weren't great, but replaying the video a few times I actually really kinda like it. Its got a nice techno-magical feel to it, the pressurised gas when you remove the mag is sci-fi, and the shining lights and hardlight bayonet are all visually appealing too. And the buddy looks like a minaturised star, its great.
if u think this is is the issue, u can just warmup in the range and when ure feeling warm enough go straight to comp. keep in mind tdm wont improve ur crosshair placement, playing dm will.
Why did you get the GPX? Just curious, I bought one and returned it within the week. Couldn't aim for shit, it's way too light and floaty and I fell for the circlejerk on reddit for it.  


Got a Zowie EC2-CW and love it.

I wish this was available for viper too
I didn't say you need to be quick . But you have to strategies a lot more than a average duelist . I'm saying because I do sometimes have to fill duelist , and most of my friends who do main duelist when i ask them what's going through their mind they "i just blind or push into the site and look for 1v1s and reposition " while a smokes player has to smoke at the right time ....have to use their abilities carefully because they're the last to enter . You wouldn't want a omen blind or astra suck or brim molly to hit your team . You need to help your team fight . While constantly looking at your abilities when your smoke is disappearing you have to call that . When you're smoke wall is going up or down you have to call that . Where you're sucking , pulling blinding mollying you have to call that still see when your smoke recharges for appropriate re-smoking . I do agree that duelist need different kind of brain power but in a scale it isn't more exhausting compared to a controller or senti or even an initiator. And this is statistically proven , duelists have way more pickrate than any other roles even in immortal radiant lobbies is because you don't need to  are for much in a round except just isolation 1v1s .

I had someone build it for me. I’ll make a vid give me a bit. I randomly joined an endurance and we all afk’d up there. Mind blown. I couldn’t find one so I begged the kid to build for me and he finally did.
Thats not what im saying. At all. What Im saying is you should just play your games and not sweat on your main and if it's an L, lose the rating. You're protecting your own off days instead of taking the consequence. Rating is not a reflection of your form on the day, it was never supposed to be. You're deliberately playing against worse players because you dont want the consequence of playing worse.
Try contacting player support on the epic games website.
Nah these arent worth anything. you can just give it to me

Couldn’t agree more. I hit dia1 last season, this season started in gold, but I’m %100 sure the golds I played with was not playing like gold. And I’m currently plat 2, but again It doesn’t feel like I’m playing with plats. The game sense, aims, movements of the lobbies are totally different. My duo is dia1, and I’m playing against ex ascendants every game.

But tbh, I’m not complaining about this. Because now every round is a fucking war, I enjoy more and I’m better player right now. It forces you to push your limits.
5v4 retake isn’t ideal
You’re not a Yoru main if you don’t hit your clone accidentally and flash your entire team every match
It can be done. Certain abilities like Reyna dismiss would be almost impossible.

Try using Ice King in lead, Powerbase Knox and Base Kyle in support and anything else you want that’s non-damaging to the base. Maybe the hero that does extra launcher damage (she’s a constructor) or something geared to your weapon of choice. The smasher should freeze and give you time to kill it. Otherwise, you could try without a base, and then use a Zenith loadout to freeze and kill smashers before they get to the base. If you have ‘sploders though, you’d have to basically hide from them.

Honestly, for all the work involved, you should just learn how to trap effectively. Even underpowered traps can play a massive role. In 140 ventures, you’d be surprised how well level 26 level tire drop traps work over spawns 😂. I was almost done Venthres so I just used up all my low level stuff for the heck of it and was shocked how well it worked. It was an awkward spawn where funnelling was almost completely impossible and there was little flat land for traps.

I totally respect however you want to play, but just wanted say that you have to use building materials anyway. Might as well funnel them and trap to ensure victory. Re-running missions suuuuuucks.
just pick clove. you can die and still smoke. plus, youll know how to smoke so you already got a good advantage over 90% of clove mains.
And here I am praying the rank reset drops me down to silver-gold where I belong because I haven't played in ages but nope, still hard stuck high plat-dia playing against ex ascendants and getting fucked.
Are the PS5 codes already available? Haven't got one so far 😭

CS has an option to queue 4 man ranked. Valo doesnt
Let's get it boi, silver Jesus will save us.
its once every 3 months
I'm a guardian main too. Sadly unless I'm some sorta RoyalG or an aim god, it's gonna be pretty impossible for me to reach even Diamond with just a guardian.

But anyways screw that. I like using just guardian irrespective of my rank and losses (I don't feel satisfied with other weapons)

I've reached peak silver 3 with mostly guardian previous act either. My tracker link (pls don't make fun of me) 😉

I'm gonna say what no one else here will say. Nothing even comes close to the effectiveness of a microphone. 

In your case you literally cannot help it and it doesn't seem like you want to be a professional player so it doesn't matter in the end. 

Once your individual skill reaches a certain level people don't give a shit whether you type or not.
I'm pretty sure there's no limit. They just stack and you can complete them all.
New copypasta just dropped
The is the most, "umm actually" 🤓☝️ comment ever 💀
Someone made it 70 and I downvoted it. Please don't mind.
Is there a way to see the music inspect?
Thanks for letting me know!
It's very annoying. I recently took a break from ranked games cuz it was starting to affect my mental.
I wanted to reach immo 1 this episode, currently stuck in asc1 and almost denoting back to Diamond, and I've had a lot of weird teams like this recently.

I understand that there's not much to do beside trying to play and win somehow but, since I can only do max 2 games per day cause of work and responsabilities, getting home to play and having to deal with this on a daily basis it's draining.

I always have enemy team muted all times, no names so I don't get triggered from seeing someone from a past game and I mute people at the first sign of stupid behavior without reasoning.
"BIRTHDAY DIFF"
It indeed was a trap
The 100$ requisite it's just to save those who have already paid the prime fee. I don't mind paying 15$ for Prime queue but I know people who do. We can have both like in CS.
Why are you getting downvoted for this lmao
look at what you posted at the top.

"I think the recent changes Riot have made have missed the fundamental problem they were trying to address. You might say it's too early to say, but I think there were more obvious, better changes to at least try first."

how is this trying to understand the logic? how is this starting discussion?

you just straight up think you are better at balancing than the devs.

give us credentials or no one will care about your opinion on balance.
Zenith, but all top 3 sections contain very good and good outlanders.
make the grenade her rechargeable ability, wall on C, and movement sensors please. If stun is too much then a slow or reveal or vulnerable. If the area is too big then make it take more time to activate or make the enemy see the trap from a longer distance
They do
Makes a lot of sense. I'll add that to my play. Thanks for explaining. 👍👍
They're all different and everyone has different opinions. Also some are better on some maps than others. But really, it's just whoever you're most comfortable with or enjoy the most.

It's just my opinion that those 3 have a higher barrier to entry because of the nuance involved early on, whereas the nuance for jett/phoenix starts a bit later and you can get by without it for a while. 

If you play yoru wrong, you cost. Same with Neon, same with Raze. With the other three, you can just sort of run it down and it'll be fine usually.
Right, because you can't use skins in Save the World. Tiresome.
Its hardware probs chief, I started valorant ep2 with 25fps at bronze 3, now im mid/high asc with 500fps 👍🏾
like a third of my college fund. I regret it now since I barely play and when I do play I'm not having fun anymore. It is what it is though :|

Raze, 1000%. A good smurf on Raze is the worst to combat, I'd take a smurfing Reyna over a smurfing Raze anyday. (Peak G2, currently G1)
Anything with concurrent players at or exceeding 20-25k players is considered a success for even a new game. One that's quickly venturing toward it's 8th year with such numbers is considered by any reasonable studio a massive success. Specially when there are points where it gets up to or exceed 100,000 players.

they def better but u cannot be stuck in that shitlow bruh. i was rad took a 1.5 year break and im nearly back
Love watching Lazvell play
Ayeeeee
Gonna be honest, this sounds completely unnecessary, and annoying as fuck.

Not that I hate the concept of playing with money, I think it’s a very slippery slope that doesn’t actually have that good rewards if done right.

Tho if I was told to make something up that interacts with money, I’d make smth like an agent that helps ur team buy bigger guns somehow, not the other way around. Making enemies lose money just sounds annoying as hell to balance and to play against, and it doesn’t actually sound fun to play as imo.
If your router doesn't have proper QoS then things like these will happen. It can also happen if your internet is extremely slow. In my case, I can browse the web and even watch videos on YouTube while downloading updates for Valorant.
They didn’t know i had an op bc i hadn’t shot it yet. Real question is why is an odin peeking mid?
solution (kind of?):  


my friend and I got it to work by just keeping the launcher open for like 5minutes then we were able to click play
Lol dude your stats are great. I think your friend is the problem they are not.
Is plat low elo? Also I don’t think anything like team comp matters in the slightest if your rank is really that low, play whoever you’re most comfortable with and you’ll have the best chance of winning.

Reyna gets picked A LOT in low elo because of how little teamwork she needs but yeah when it goes good for a reyna it goes really good but when it doesn’t man is it ugly
My all time skin is ion op
So the smokes role just don't exist then
If you're getting tilted in DM, you're just not ready to rank up.
Bet me too
If they are hitting body shots, you still have massive advantage of you can consistently hit headshots, for instant with a ‘fifty percent’ headshot rate Is that not an infinitely faster way to kill someone than to hit them 4 times in the body?
The estimate seems shady since EA doesn't ask gender so where do those stats come from? Most player names are completely gender neutral so could be anyone. 

We don't turn on our microphones because "ARE YOU A GIRL" is annoying AF. Yes, there are women that video game. There are a lot of us. But the rude sexual comments and misogynistic crap is not something I want to hear in my play-time if I'm in with randos so mostly, my microphone is off. 

So rather than assumethat all players that have muted themselves are guys, play for a couple days assuming that they're all women. Because they might be.

That’s a mood, I got from iron(rank in ep 2 I believe) to silver(my current rank) and plan to get gold either this act or next episode but with college and track haven’t had time to grind for more than 25-50 games so I understand my chances of getting out of silver is slim and it’s more reasonable to expect I can get from s1-s3 in the amount of time I play. I also try to avoid q if I am tilted(something I try to work on not being but coming from being a very competitive athlete is hard to let go of) so I rarely play comp as unrated is more fun and somewhere I can practice, make mistakes and it not effect my teammates poorly other than a loss in the career tab
This is good news. It's going to tick off griefers.
Riot doesn’t care about toxic voice and text comms unless it is in English. 

In English a word like retard or brain dead will get banned, but if you use any other language? You can say the worst thing ever and won’t get even a warning.

Anything Oni imo
just play your game man worst case  just mute them all and pay a lot of attention to the map it still works good luck on your grind!
Kid in kindergarten is in the same rank as the mans who got divorced bc of his Valorant addiction💀

Half floors confuse husks and people think half floors are the only fell defence needed, it just makes husks find a wall it alternate path. 

It's not a perfect base but it's cheap, has no effect against lobbers, flingers, smashers or blasters though, maybe some more

Iron is harder than bronze, silver, and maybe gold because of smurfs
They made Reyna accurately Mexican. Soulless, takes other people's energy, and racist. Sounds about right.
Huh
Most normal little use of abilities in Valorant match
How does this work? I have XBOX game pass and need all the agents on one of my alt accounts.
Now that I think about it, double duelist happens more commonly than double controller so you could flex that.
The game installs fine, it specifically mentions corrupted date being the issue
Sounds like we found our problem. Yes, it's quite a drastic penalty, and it's made worse by being able to die by one hit. I suggest going to the shooting range and seeing for yourself exactly how far off the mark a stray bullet goes when you're moving and shooting

And strafing is a thing here, but you need to strafe in between shots. So strafe, shoot, strafe, shoot, but never both at the same time.

It’s so extreme they are all doing in with the upcoming return of the pirate season soon in 1-2 months.

TL;DR Holding spike is the same speed as holding knife.  


You got me curious, so I booted up a custom.  Haven as Sova.  Lined up down C long, equipped knife, and held W from dragon until I hit the box at the back of C site while using my watch's stopwatch.  (8.29s).  Held S until I was back in the original spot, then swapped to spike and held W until I hit the box again.  (8.31s)  So it's likely the exact same, just the slightest of delays on one run.
Well, yes, that is however only working if non of them where checking I main/lobby. If I would do that I would fear to be completely disconnected from the play for half the round. Probably have to go through that in my mind when I have my head free
Rolled past the tittle and saw most of the image the first thing I thought was that’s some old Fortnite model and rendering doubt many people would recognize it lol

less than 10. Usually in the 6-8 range. It's the advantage of living on a college campus with fiber in almost every apartment building in the area.
Yeah that’s what I’m saying, does this power extend to control or just communication, is it possible he could mind control people or radiants is that why Reyna acts nice to him
90 isn’t bad if it’s consistent and you don’t lose frames. No reason why you can’t get to diamond
Thank you. It helps! and I’m sorry for posting it wrong!
I see you are a russian person. Do you use a vpn?
Do you?
I got the Battle Pass knife from Kay-O's act and I think it's good enough. Yeah a karambit or butt plugs sounds cool but knifing in this game is nothing like CSGO where you can resell them, actually knife your opponents correctly, use it as a transition between shots, etc.
I thought the same, until I played breeze. 
For me low sense works because if you have a high sensi it is very hard to microadjust ur crosshair(for me personally)
A lot of people don’t have friends who play Fortnite let alone STW or even 3 friends that play video games.

I’m not saying the game isn’t fun. I’m saying this game isn’t finished and they never cared to finish it.

Is it worth to give them your money. In my opinion no.
Mad cuz bad

Reyna and sabine seem much older based on their dialogue alone


Neon seems young, but given her backstory she should be much older imo

It's curious how many of you just read the first example but not the second one. They do this a lot of times, not just at pistol round
Yeah, but domt you think if I was going against ascendant players and above as a D2 I would get at lwast around the same level teammates? I honestly don't feel like that's the case rn even given their actual/peak ranks.
I’m curious about your load out with no cooldown…can you share? I run outlander most always unless it is a defend mission…
Having good crosshair placement is important.
You could at least see what they were trying to do? Saying that's terrible doesn't help, they probably know that as much as it's self explanatory why it sucks.

If they were all 100% blinded, and OP landed some shots, it would have made for a nice clip
This habit did not last long but I unironically started as a controller player by smoking the choke we were pushing through. I had the logic right that it gave us more angles to push from but what I did not account for was that I was smoking completely improperly and that, when playing agents that did not have 3 smokes, I would no longer be able to do that.
1 map change woulda been nice, - Breeze + literally any of the maps currently removed
I also see various peak Asc/Dia in my G2 lobbies, but they're in gold for a reason. Don't let peak rank get in your head, I'm actually winning/putting up a good fight against these higher ranks despite peaking P1 a few eps ago
tbf with this new act. everythings fuked . my friend was asc1 last act not hes silver 3 stuck . its so shit rn
Still gold players should have better aim than iron
Ok awesome
Just because I'm unrated doesnt mean im bad lmao mmr exists yaknow
I'd love to see your gameplay. I think there's a lot to learn from.
We're gonna starve!
[removed]
I HIGHLY agree! Women are always target to be trashtalked in the game, and i dont like that... because literally 80% of the women in the game give me a mental boost while playing and that helps a bit, the other 20% are either E-daters or very toxic witches... (at least in EU servers)
everyone’s favorite is debatable but this is fire
Show your gameplay then i bet you do crouch spray, also 4 vandal bullets is weird to where it isnt tap firing but also not really spraying
tracker or this is fake
Try .5 800DPI
Can I ask why this is? I'm returning to valorant after having not played since release. Why is it that duoing is bad for rank climbing?
Go for it!
I recommend to check out Eggwick video on Youtube about it. It's very close to my own opinion. In general, from empirical evidence, players with "expensive" skins tend to get better statistics, but the percentage drops gradually with the raising of players' rank. Whether it's a psychological effect or something that deals with skin's mechanics is not settled.

From my experience, I don't own any of "expensive" skins, but once I equip one from dead body, I frequently get some nasty multi-kills. I don't believe it's just a placebo, it doesn't work like that. But maybe it's simply a matter of tracers.
[removed]
Maybe in the case of yours since you are higher elo than me. I don't see Reyna players being a smurf, mostly the smurfs in my game are either chamber or astra, sometimes phoenix and keep laughing in chat or typing "get better" (they're "kinda" right though) when they should be the one who should be better. And yeah, the botfrag, yes, that's me, I botfrag literally all the time and get less than 10 kills. Sometimes, they would get mad which is understandable but some do understand. There was even a team where they tried to get me kills but didn't work because I whiffed.
Nope sadly ;-;
I can smell how boring it is before it even exist
Well it helps if you can anticipate the flash is coming. Other than that just turn around.
sure upload it to youtube I'll take a look
damn people in this thread are being so rude. it is similar to ow but much closer to counter strike. the spray pattern is very consistent for the first 6-7 bullets so you can learn to counter it with a slow down and left pull for most guns. for the most part you want to stop, shoot two bullets and move again. aiming makes the crosshair follow the recoil but makes you and your gun slower so it’s not worth u less at like 30 meters away or further imo.
If they had cs maps then sova and viper would just be picked every game.
All ranged defenders have that perk built right in I'm sure. Just that it's bugged now, so for burst weapons, it can refund you more bullets than you've spent.

Gammatron seems to have the fastest fire rate of all energy cell burst guns, so you'll get energy cells back, faster. For now. I'm sure they'll patch it one day.
You weren’t just dialed in bro u had 3 ounces of white stuff up your nose and powder in your red bull that shit was fuckin insane
60 ping is completely fine for matchmaking stop coping and blaming your connection
It doesn’t bother me. What bothers me is when one person uses op then 5 others are like “screw you im opping too”. It’s fine to practice with op, and I actually like practicing against them as well, as frustrating as it may be.
i hate it personally, it’s why i only bought the melee (i love the inspect spin cause it satisfies my adhd)
Oh yeah, I remember seeing that! Good times… I know I’m definitely going to be playing as the Terminator when that event comes back.

And also hating the chrome husks.
> I often get people in my games who seem out of place, they're either way too good for my elo or way too bad

You just described every match I've been in since Episode 1 ACT 1.

From my perspective its all been the same as its always been. 

I am in the same boat as you.  Was Plat and got placed Silver, and now I am Gold 3 at 85RR (almost back where I was).  

I get people in my games who have full Ascendant triangles.  So far every single one of them has been terrible.  My guess is they were boosted, and they are not handling the reset very well.  

I also get people who peaked Gold their whole Valorant career, but are just absolute monsters in game.  

I check trackers frequently and haven't seen anything too unusual.  

My take on this is the players who grind this game every day are continuing to play every day and show up in your lobbies.  Then the players who can never fill out a triangle pop in and out every few games and go "woah, I suck, time to play something else until this dies down."  

I think its all in everyones head.  I've only been playing like 1 comp game a day since the release of this new episode and I am almost back to where I was.
tomorrow at shop reset
It's not smurfing to go against an Imm player in unrated, it's just bad matchmaking. It shouldn't matter much anyways because the way I see it as long as you're not trolling Comp it is ok to make a new account and play in other modes. I've gone against new accounts plenty of times in Unrated (today I went against 3 in a row) where we got crushed but honestly don't take it too personally and just try to surrender or troll (of course don't be toxic and do anything against the Rito rules) if it does get really bad. Smurfing is still really bad in Comp though that's a different matter altogether.
Mine is 8.7% At silver 1
I just had a game on Haven and MAAAAN I've missed that map. I saw some people complaining about the new shop UI, I think it looks really good, also the little animations I think are cool.

Iso getting crazy off almost all of my games is, something that I wasn't expecting lol.
Because ignorant. He's trained for years, but you can't look past his irrelevant skin colour.
>I’m pc only

Then maybe don't interject baseless assumptions based on your extremist biased and untrue opinions? 

Games like this typically never have aim assist on console.
It’s not bad all the time
K/d, adr and combat points don't affect mmr. Your fights affect encounter mmr. Those stats don't.
For the skins that on the account
I don’t play like forsaken lmao. And that’s one player out of millions.
satchels
I was only in it for Yujin Ah
You could also just play some rounds deathmatch every day and that‘s it

At least that is what i did back then when i started with counter strike in CSS because there was no aimlabs
U forgot the bp has been shit as well . 
O sry it always has been.🗿

Other games make great battlepasses.


Only good battlepasses wer the starting 1to 3  bp and a few exceptions like karambit.
yes but that job of getting kills is usually only to her benefit and getting kills can be done by any agent that has way more useful abilities than reyna. Reyna is a character you can only play when you are better than every single enemy player by far which usually with 90% of reyna players is not the case. I understand that playing reyna makes sense when you are hardstuck gold but have good mechanics that are way above your rank but as soon as you start to climb higher the skill difference between the individual players usually get lower and lower which makes reyna only playable for smurfs and mechanical demons which sadly makes up about 10% maybe of the reyna players
Just keep playing and upgrading your PL.
In my experience it's way easier to win if we use the characters we're most familiar with.
> This way, you won't take skins on the ground and reveal your position. 

It's always crazy/infuriating when I see teammates go for skins in rounds instead of killing the enemy. Like they'll stand there picking between 3 or 4 guns just because they've got a few seconds in cover.
ur the goat bro
I never backseat. I just ping enemy locations for you with my walls <3
I didn’t say that, but blaming teammates is a common mistake that prevents players from genuinely improving. Forget about your teammates, forget about your RR and just play to the best of your ability. Then watch the games back if you can record without causing performance drops, thinking about what you should’ve done better. The matchmaking system isn’t out to get you, in fact it’s you + 4 randoms vs 5 randoms so if you consistently play well you will be rewarded. I see this teammate blaming all the time in LoL but at the end of the day it’s only you that’s responsible for your climb
"im a fucking sova. i reveal, you kill you [insult]"
Both cypher and viper do better on sunset thou I don't understand
Thanks for the info 👍🏼
ah yes the SHOOTER game valorant
it works now!

for like 1 week got changed pretty fast
ISO is a terror now tbh. He practically forces the other team to have good habits of double swinging and taking engagements with the team. It's OK, but he's a terror in low ELO. 

He forces a different set up needed for 12 rounds of DEF.

Is he overtuned? Hard to say. I do like using him though.
H
Its a good method which alot of pro players recommend because in most of the times you don’t have to crouch but you do, so thats a good practice to get rid of that bad habbit
Took like 1.5-2 years but I only played like 40 hours of ranked in that time. For me it wasn't from a lack of success and more due to not playing ranked enough to boost my mmr enough to rank up. For context, in that same span, I've put in about 500 hours of unrated.
Edit:
At least you’re not whining about everything…
Oh! Thank you for letting me know! I felt so bad. ggs
trash
She's a selfish, solo-queue, smurf agent that brings nothing to a team if you can't get kills. She isn't meta hence why you never see her in pro play
Immortal player here.  What people tell me when they play against me in customs is "they never get a fair fight".  I won't ever take a 50/50 against worse players, I wait for a teammate with utility to peek with or wait for my enemy to make a mistake I can exploit.
Probably because other games have bots or setup bots to entice players

Keep playing and eventually you’ll get to people your skill level

To be clear I don't have a problem with your conclusions, what I'm now thinking is that Clip's perk is out of whack somehow. Either she's dropping more extra mats in support than she should be, or she's dropping fewer extra mats in lead than she should be.
Play comp ig

I don't really know what a good KAST% is but I just checked my match history since hitting plat 3 and it's been hovering around 85%. I also almost exclusively play sage so I am mostly hanging back and using my util more while I let the rest of the team run in and get kills
Why not both?
got ion and oni for around 30% off :)
you just enter tower mision and build 3.. why need help ?

you expect someone else do job for you ?
Nade got nerfed too and that's a free ability. Satchel are basically unchanged for movement. That's what I meant.
My mom dislikes its very much when i talk loudly at 3am. I solved this by just gettinf a better headset so that i can be understood when i talk quitely
Based on you and your wifes progress, different things work for different people. You had 10k hours in CSGO, she had 0... two wildly different paths. As you've said, coaching isn't necessary, but some people respond better to it. Some people respond better to brute forcing hours. Some people like your wife respond to just playing and chasing headshots. Everybody has a path that's better suited to them.

The above you would have to separate on your personal feelings of Woohoojin. It's okay to not like him, but it shouldn't affect your opinion of coaching in general as a concept.
Because most people do the missions alone and nuts n bolts take a lot of time to farm,  i can't find people on my server unless is a vbuck mission,  and some basic farm get u materials for walls and stuff, but not for advanced traps.

He's an aggressive sentinel. He can lock down a whole site by himself even right now with just one trip
I learned something new today. Cheers.
You can only beat a smurf if the rest of their team are that much weaker than yours, if the 4 other teamates are as strong as you and your teamates you can't win.


But what you can do is hold an angle that you know the smurf always take (smurf are very confident and will try to hold W and take as many kills as possible) with a judge or a odin, you can do it with another teamate if you dont feel confident enough and you can destroy him.


(Even if you don't win make the game as unbearable as possible to him, smurfers have tiny little ego and can get butthurt really fast, and a angry player = a bad player)
That's hilarious ngl
I was going to point them to the BR subreddit until I realized that this technically still works here because of the heros
W Archer
honestly the marshal is goated, you just gotta not use it at close range or unscoped
he gave you the correct answer, though. you need to nicely ask "hey i think  there's a trip here (ping trip on map) can you please \*insert ability here\* to break it so i can entry for us?
There’s a difference between asking nicely and flaming. If I get asked nicely I’ll do my best to satisfy the command. If I get flamed that’s my fallback answer. I don’t flame my own team, instead I’ll either play around their preferences or be selfish.
If you can find a gun better than the xenon and plasmatic discharger WITHOUT having to take up my entire support squad to cater to it I’ll switch to it
Blud I’m ascendant 2 and once my game had plat 3 and immortal 2 😭
I have a fix for you my friend:

In Windows:  
- Settings  
- System  
- Display  
- Graphics  
- Change default graphics settings  
- Turn off the "Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling" option  
- Restart PC  

Fixed this exact same problem for me (PC freeze after alt tabbing to a web browser, only leaving the sound working, and forcing me to restart). It fixed the same problem for my girlfriend. And it causes no problem to the PC, I don't know what this option even did.
Skye can’t heal herself…
Me too. I've been waiting for a protocol knife tho
OP what they are saying is that harbour and any controller requires good team play and because iron provides terrible teammates harbour isn't good for iron players who want to rank up. You should pick someone who can do everything by themselves. Someone like Reyna who can heal, flash and dismiss.

That just isnt true lol. Maybe you arent practicing enough… lots of 35+ year old players still have amazing aim
guns shoot bullets
[removed]
Rip, yeah without building traps I don’t think you can be entirely afk. Though the lower level stonewood missions should still be essentially afk enough when you place down a few traps. Surround it in spiked floors and ceiling electric fields or something
Just send in 10 different smokes and play 3 molly lineups, then smoke tunnel around spike with a shorty. Easy win.
Are you having fun when you play?  If you enjoy playing then keep playing.
Don't play if you realize your mouse was broken 🤷
My top gun is spike rush used to be bucky and shorty. Happy?
Ahhh I see! Yeah I’ve played on mumbai servers in the past and it was horrible, I get what you mean :( One possibility can be to mute people as soon as they get toxic (voice and text if necessary), but it can be a shitty situation :( Once they’re muted you can focus on your gameplay without their annoying distractions.

And yes, you’re right in saying that map knowledge is a likely issue. Deathmatches can be good to get a better idea of important angles on different maps (although getting repeatedly shot in the back can be frustrating lol)
Those are used a lot because they are some of the best weapons in the game. My main weapons in order is Xenon, discharger, baron. Unless I'm running a specific build that's the exact order I always have my weapons
Read the post again
No one use "q" For walk 🥲
What's your peak rank?
entitled to always take the spike or defuse when it would be more beneficial for someone else. idk about you but I've seen people throw fits over not being given the spike
I have waited 355 days to get mine (i really counted), watching every days (as much as I could). I hope you will get tour sooner
Honestly those are annoying as hell! Multiple months and I haven't reached anywhere near "cracked".
Holy smokes, that's AMAZING! If valorant had skins for agents, I would spam Riot's emails everyday to add it to the game hehehe
To piss me off
I’ve done 680 acs
Send the tracker link and I’ll take a look. Are you solo queuing? Duo? Is your duo better than you? Do you and your duo run agents that work together and can coordinate plays? Does you or your duo IGL at all? All of this stuff matters in high elo.
technically, it falls under the account sharing but seeing how easy it is to make a new account and bans are just account and not hardware bans, boosters can easily make a new one and boost there
you cant be playing fortnite on gut bacteria...
By that logic you’re acknowledging that chamber has the impact of at least 2 different agents haha (senti/Jett)
I thought maybe it would reduce idk
The scoreboard (ACS) is not used for the ranked system, it is just a method of organizing the end game stats.

nobody understands their role in iron. they probably couldn't even tell you the name of their character's role or even what most agents' abilities even do. focus on moving between bursts, always aiming for the enemy's head, and not having abilities out when it is dangerous. 

Are you able to play at a consistent FPS of 60+, use ethernet instead of wifi, and have adequate mousepad space with an eDPI between 200-400? if the answer to any of those is 'no', then they are likely holding you back immensely.
Join his discord and tell him about it I'm sure he'd be interested and love it
Nah, dude got downvoted for saying something that the devs confirmed. That is not what Spectrolite final design would’ve look like.
I think we all agree that upgrading your monitor from 60hz to 144hz is more significant than your audio quality BUT it is not a valid upgrade if your fps when playing valorant is under 120
Why do I have to scroll so much to find a single mention of Chronovoid. Y'all are sleeping on that skin.
in my experience, i win more games with bottom fragging reynas. if a reyna is top fragging, they usually cannot play with the team. theres a reason they top frag but are still in the same elo as me.

> the point is to have fun playing it* 

EXACTLY!  How is it fun to have your teammates give up round 5?  Its pathetic.  I want to play through the match. 

>Look man if you want to be miserable playing games to prove you’re not a coward and didn’t get abused as a kid (you relating this to ff’ing in a video game is wild btw) go ahead. 

I don't want to be miserable playing.  I want to have fun and play the game I logged in to play.  Not surrender at round 5.  If I wanted a shorter match I would play swiftplay. 

>Me personally? I’m gonna have fun playing a game and getting shitstomped isn’t my idea of “fun”

Me personally?  I'm gonna have fun playing a game and quitting round 5 isn't my idea of "fun"
It will be the most unbalanced team ever, gold to immortal in a single lobby, also 5 stacking in unrated would be hilarious
Ok thanks
I think youre 'slightly' overestimating an importance of low elo comms. Ngl, my habit of checking minimap every 5 seconds gave me more info than my  teammates up to high gold.

Dear everyone,

*It's mid.*

Best regards,

It's growing on me a little bit more with the changes, but yeah it's my least fav. Last time it was in rotation I got  3 day ban I dodged it so much
Uhh that's just hard facts? 0.8 is nowhere near good for a reyna? Hello?
Sadly I’m not in collage but where would u recommend finding a team
On a scale of 1-10 how hard are you trying to climb
I started Jan last year but hadn't played any PC shooters beforehand (nor any shooters for the previous 7 yrs/stopped gaming).

Started bronze 1 when I finally did comp mid last year and hit gold at the start of this year and my aim still sucks (comp HS 10% even though my KD has gone up to 0.9-1.0). I have like 3k hours lol.

You're getting better, just takes time.

I queue with friends who have better aim (and destroy me in 1v1s) but are hella inconsistent (MVP one game, bot frag next) and have worse game sense.
Kj is not better on breeze than cypher. 
Y'all are crazy. Viper is the most versatile. That orb of hers is so underrated. She isn't the easiest, but she's very powerful on every map. If you do her wall right, you can block off so much of the map
Mine is Derank1
There are a few more but these are the most useful ones in my opinion
preach brother😂🙌
U should cuz what i told u isn't some random philosophy my bradar. Its how mmr works in fps games. If u beat ppl from higher rank ur mmr will go higher which means more plus rr and even if u lose u will lose less rr.

Example - if im a plat player who get matched constantly with dia n asc and if i beat them my mmr will go higher. But on the other hand if i constantly keep losing against golds and silvers my mmr will go lower which means i will keep gaining low elo like 12 14 + for win and lose elo easily like -20 etc.
Definitely a hard role to play, more so in lower ranks.
how?? get help

Of course. Try reframing your question though:

Can you become a great musician without scales? Can you become a great athlete without weight or endurance training? Can you become a great artist without figure shape or figure exercises?

Sure, you can do all odds those things, but it will take longer and your fundamentals might be lacking somewhere. If you seriously want to rank up a lot (and quickly), do aim training. If you don’t and you don’t find it fun, then don’t aim train.

Put one toxic player in the 1.2 team and great communication to the 0.9 team and I'd bet the 0.9 team would win.
Nice collection. I myself have 19 legendary and 24 epic Fortsville Slugger schematics.
okay buddy thank you
By any chance, does it have "legacy" perks (in which you're unable to upgrade any of them)? There should also be an option to "convert" it to a standard version where you're able to upgrade their perks.
Only one viable team comp, was my original hate.


Now, maybe with new agents we'll see a meta change. It was frustrating in ranked to feel like youve lost at char select when your team doesnt lock in the default strat. Ugh.


And losing a comeback to just rush A 5 times is a feels bad. Other maps it feels like you have an option to at least get 2/3, its hard to not get overrun and rely on retake.
Hi, this is the StW sub, you want r/FortniteBR

Honestly, music didnt quite die in the 90s. But good music taste in the general public kinda did. But yeah, i liked RATM back in the day, now not so much anymore. 

Iso's tracks are very hip hoppy. chinese hip hop, sounds quite modern. Not exactly my style but fits him perfectly and I really get into character when i play.
Maybe 1 in every 100 games I’ll win a Haven game with no smokes. It’s literally the only one possible to play smokeless
[deleted]
That's why I like iso. Or at least, killing iso
I have a friend I play with. He either gives the best call outs or the worst. One time he said all hard pushing B. As soon as I left my hiding spot on A, I had 5 enemies come running onto sight and they mowed me down. But there's also the time he told me where to shoot on a wallbangable wall and I got a headshot. He's really hit or miss so I always want to trust him but I'm so hesitant also.
King 👑
This happens more than you think sadly
If you play a lot of comp you'll maybe have 1/40? I would think even higher where there are throwers or bots
Like I was a 4v5 and we were winning so the oppo chamber started to throw it kind of messed them up cause we were down a man... I don't get it but ppl are weird
where do i acquire such friends 😔
Omen is just fine and I played Brim to diamond this advice is silly. 1. Keep improving all aspects of your game play 2. Get good sleep 4. Hydrate 3. Work on your mental.

We can't teach you how to work on all of this without being a 1on1 coach but there's enough youtube content to guide you. Start with woohoojin. Your gold so watch his plat and diamond guides to see what you're not doing well and what to avoid.

Hate the System not the Player. I hate that gun, but as Long as they dont Nerf it, Go for it
really? damn i didn't know. must be a different studio then. I guess im just so used to OW making their own lol.
Am I really lucky or what??? 1k hours+ total never seen a cheater. Maybe sus stuff but maybe they’re just good…
Maybe and I wouldn't know. For sure, for me specifically, it's cheaper as I'm not good enough at tunneling to set tunnels with 4 atlas with potentially difficult terrain when I can just connect all their roofs and figure it our from there
Please 😂 gold in valorant is worse than cs2 silver
I wouldn’t mind if they reverted his shield and buffed his other abilities. Problem with OG iso is that it’s hard to do anything with his other abilities to start building shield momentum. Buff the wall and maybe increase width of vulnerable and he’s gonna be a solid agrnt
Well if you get caught and keep running you'll be tagged and then the trip will kind of reset itself. So if another person walked through they would get caught until they trigger it as well. The only way you can continually get hit by the trip is if you stand in the line after you've already been stunned. So I'm assuming if you died it would reset and allow for more people to get caught yes
A lot of the stuff WOOHOOjin teaches when I saw his videos was fundamental stuff and is valuable to most of his viewers. When I watch him coach high ranks; its more-so teaching some fundamentals but really teaching his play-style. Some things cant be taught and are learned through the grind. (Immo 3)

Not really. It came to me as common sense way before playing fps games. However I only learned it as a fully fledged concept after playing.
I know... I assumed it was from a crow, or boar loot, but unclaimed, as sometimes seems to be the case.
Glad someone mentioned this, whenever i spectate randos they can’t seem to keep their cursor still
I did the contrary, played sentinel and controller (KJ/Brim) from Iron to P2, and went to D2 with Reyna/Skye lol.
Sinatraa that mf and jiggle spam
yeah it was my first ever vandal that i’ve got and still Im going back to him, cuz it’s really a 🤌🏿
just Poppin swing and hope they miss
> aim is irrelevant since you'll die if you're shooting it while they peek

Not really? If it is executed absolutely perfectly then sure, but let's be real, in 99% of cases it's not going to be perfect. Most of the time, unless you're super close to the corner, there is enough time to shoot the utility and swing back up for a shot - but only if you are fast enough.

> and if you're in a safe place destroying smth like a sova dart then you cannot tell me that putting your crosshair back on the angle requires much aim at all.

Why not? Especially if enemies are pushing close behind it, getting your crosshair back and steady does require a good bit of mouse control. 

[This isn't the best example but look at how he wants to hold A lobby, has to spin 180 to hit the dart, and that window is enough for Reyna to come in and break his crosshair placement, forcing him to have to land a flick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg90iFK1Di0&t=40s).

> Plus Jett dash isn't supposed to be used into enemies like that, she generally dashes into smokes and behind cover

That's exactly what I'm thinking of - instead of just being able to place your crosshair at some chokepoint, Jett will smoke-dash in and now you have to deal with 2 angles - crosshair placement alone isn't going to be enough to save you there.
💀
I guess if you got a kill before. But if we are talking a pure 1v5, absolutely not. The only util Reyna has at her disposal is her flashes and if she ult, basically a temporary stim beacon. Her being able to clutch a 1v5 would rely solely on the enemy team making the egregious mistake of giving her a fair duel. Compare this to say Raze who can use their nades and satchles to isolate that 1v1 or a Yoru who can use their util to misdirect the enemies and find a gap in their chain.
I hated it too, but now that new breeze is there, my only want is to play on Fracture. I main kj but I feel like Fracture is or :
-you get destroyed
-you destroy them
lol yeah 😂i mean it went through microsoft so i can’t be banned for just using their service🤷‍♂️
Kj,the design is cool,i like to have information and have a tool to give a lot of damage,but im beginning to play cypher because the idea of having something to give me information from the other side of the map is cool, especially because i am a player who likes to uso the tools to get kills,but i have being a duelist and like the slow pace of the sentinels

The vending machine is an rng-based weapon dropper exclusively in the venture zone.

This zone is different from the main game - It's practically a start-over where you lose everything in your inventory and cannot craft any weapons. Doing this zone rewards you with various resources. It does not effect your main game in anyway. 

The vending machine in specific is what gives you weapons for this zone, since you can't craft your own. It gives you 3 choices in exchange for resources that'll depend where you are in ventures. Can only pick one and then it'll disappear.

Worse than it’s ever been and just odd to push in general unless going through tube. You have to watch your back from so many angles when pushing mid to A. You have below/inside/above tube, tube entrance, mid ramps, mid to A, behind if you get flanked, and then you have spawn to cover if you do get through. Corner clearing madness with no team flow to execute

They literally do lmao go to settings then controls then press right stick it will take you to presets that have that
Don't think that's a good idea, there'd be 2 very different sets of people playing. Those who take it seriously, and those who don't because it's not standard competitive. I think that'd make it very frustrating to participate in for both sides.


Also I think a competitive scene for TDM would create hard metas which would ruin the mode imo.

I would say a majority of the people I've come across who are playing with smurfs for whatever reason are women playing with guy smurfs. I'm not trying to be sexist, and I'm a woman myself, but it really makes me more frustrated to see a woman getting boosted than a man, because it directly affects me when I get called boosted for having a bad game or people don't believe I climbed to my rank solo queuing just because I'm a woman and there is a stereotype of "boosted egirls". 

Which honestly, I wouldn't even mind that much if those women getting boosted weren't so toxic. Had a teammate the other day call out the enemy Skye who couldn't get past 5 kills in 18 rounds, while their duo had 30+, on their 0.6 kd that they saw on Val tracker, and the obscenities the Skye proceeded to spew in all chat ended up getting them muted mid-game.
I just keep an Xbox controller plugged in and then use that when this comes up and also for recycling
Yeah , in some cases they're similar but other no. Tar pits are usually used for stopping smashers where as floor freeze are great with pretty much any ceiling trap above it
Still no replay mode bruh
Maybe you should read the rules because this is not allowed here or a lot of subreddits and the fact you are spamming this is in multiple subreddits makes this against reddits tos so you could be suspended or banned from the platform entirely
lol this is stupid

icebox isn't bad because its vertical and that makes it hard to aim its because it has quite literally zero space for defenders to fight for (no "mains"). its just a single chokehold.

breeze isnt bad because its long range gun fights make you take hard duels but because it forces you to play very specific comps that aren't really fun to force short ranged gunfights (viper cypher jett will appear in 90% of games)
it shows the highest I got in the season of what I finish at? for the act rank number thing I mean. i’m kind of new to this and there’s not much info in the game :/
your initiator seems to be pretty good, do you enjoy initiator? allows for teamwork but also solo plays :)
How is there a definitive best?

Different missions are better with different traps

The only thing I can say with 100% certainty is that flame grills are ass and by far the worst trap

It's hard to compare otherwise as all others do have their use cases. How much are your tar pits gonna help when you get a lobber wave? You need a combination of a few to get the best use of them all

Sometimes I can't figure out what she's saying 😂 especially the one that goes "I take lungu lungu killa meh, ma own style way I take killah".
100%
I have no idea how people can see someone making a new account and stomping low ranked games as anything less than cheating.
If you’re constantly topfragging as Sentinel or Controller, that means you’re playing selfishly and it’s likely you’re just cleaning up a lot of low-impact frags, such as when you’re stuck in 1v3+ and you get 1 or 2 against opponents who aren’t fully trying because they know they’ll eventually get traded. 

There will absolutely be matches where you’re playing well, playing for the team, and getting lots of high impact frags but you lose because your teammates just aren’t winning their 1v1s or are playing stupidly. 

But if everyone on your team is bad or having a bad game EVERY time they’re on a team with you? You’re the problem. 

It’s the old saying, if everyone you meet is an asshole, you’re the asshole. It holds true here. 

If you’re communicating with the team, helping set each other up for success, etc, you will win more often and you will rank up. 

Playing well is about far more than fragging, especially on the roles you claim to play.

But if they did they should add it to her sprint ability and give her a speed boost after jumping off a wall like lucio so she can go mach 9 across the map
9.2 win%??
I still don't get it , what have I done?
Occasionally happens in my ranked matches and its so bizarre. 

I appreciate when they do it in agent select though.  Then I can dodge. 

If they wait until in game to do it I just insta mute.  Usually takes them like 10 rounds before they figure it out and I hear another teammate go "I think he might have muted you." lol.
Look again mate, a LOT of people have mentioned Skye
It’s the perfect skin for me, and i wish i could show you a gameplay of me holding it, i just don’t have it
Yeah you are right im double thinking my moves, in this play i saw reyna get killed so i was thinking i should throw to elbow but yeah i got killed so many times with utils on my hand so i switch it back to gun luckily i was a little bit faster and got the kill. Yeah im definitely gonna work my comms more. Thanks man for the tips
Depends on the situation really.

- If you are on site and the rest of your team dies and the whole enemy team is charging towards you, you should at least try to clutch, you never know what will happen. Even if you fail, you still at least took out 2-3 people and mess up their economy even by a small margin.

- If everyone dies defending site and you are still in the middle of rotating or you are somewhere else, just find a secluded spot and save your gun. 

- If you want, hide at an off-angle or somewhere where they usually run from the spike, you can secure some exit frags as they run away with their knives out. If you kill them with something like an eco weapon like a shotgun or Stinger, you can nab their gun before the next round starts.

- If it's a 1v2, I'd say go for it.

- If you're the last one left, and managed to save your Chamber's or Jett's Operator, run like hell and save it. Your Chamber or Jett will thank you.

- A little irrelevant, if you have a Vandal or an expensive weapon, you can throw it outside the map when you are at a tight spot. For example, the enemy team kills your whole team and they would be charging at you and expecting a free upgrade, just find a spot and throw your gun out of the map. You'll die, but they won't be able to take your gun.
Boaster was a CS pro before Valorant
Cypher mains are chefs kiss, he can be realllyyyyyy annoying to play against. Thanks!
I'm now going to make it my personal vendetta to take every gekko detain kill I can. You've only done this to yourselves. If you want kills that bad, go play duelist.
I wonder what the probability of that is.
[removed]
Ok thanks I'll have to check some out
Yoru because hes self sustainable meaning that instead of you needing to ask for a flash from your skye you just do it yourself, because he can rotate very fast and because he can create space for his team on attack
You can't get positive RR if you loose though so it's entirely team outcome based. I also don't know how to show my tracker on here
See, I was playing 200 edpi long long time ago, like 1+ year ago. It's not easy to switch back to a higher sens. Although it easier to get used to a lower sense. I will practice to get the same as 136 eDpI and even better. Wish me luck 🤞

Good luck!

Idk if it's just me, but this advice feels really unsuited to the elo OP is in.

>You didn't use any abilities or do anything to watch flank nor protect your team's zone. By having everyone go to B main, you lose all control over Attacker's Base, Mid, and A Main automatically. This will make it riskier for your team to rotate, easier for the enemy team to rotate, and if an enemy is pushing, they will gain too much valuable information

This is playing defaults and lurking. There's not a single silver player in the game who knows how to default or lurk properly. I doubt there's even anyone under plat who does. Placing turret to cover the immediate flank or mid control is fine for getting to Gold. I hardly even see sentinels in ascendant do anything more. 

>Why buy Sheriff in 1st and 2nd round

Lot of people ragging on OP for buying sheriff when it's a tiny issue. I've seen plenty of clips of nats or fns buying sheriff on KJ pistol. People buy sheriff after losing pistol too, just usually without the light shield, and playing more aggressive to get value with it.

>Placing your turret in the spots you chose in game don't really help your team at all

I saw OP place it outside b main to watch flank, then pick it up and move it elbow when they rotated. Seems good enough to me. I doubt any KJ below diamond would do anything more.

>Long TTK. Stop aiming for too long. Just aim and shoot

I can see the intent, but just aim and shoot is worded almost sarcastically badly. Just work on your aim regularly, do warmups and find an aimlabs practice routine to run after you're done comp for the day. Do crosshair placement and peeking drills. Clean up diagonal peeking and poor movement. It's better to have actionable steps that are easier to follow as opposed to just shoot faster.
If we're going by gold standards then pick literally any agent in the game and just throw the kit out, it doesn't matter cause they're all bad at the game. Why would you not pick your agent with the mentality of getting good enough so they can play in higher elo lobbies?
lol how are silver lobbies at NA??? At Frankfurt silver players got a 30% headshot percentage and iron players play often w/silver

I'm currently trying to use the vandal more because the Phantom kind of tempts me to spray & pray. Trying to work on my trigger discipline and calm aim.
keep playing it bro. you said you enjoy it which is the most important thing and will make it easy to rack up the hours and learn how to be effective on him. then when you get to the higher ranks you gonna be a demon and your teammates will love you
At best it's a 1v4 ace clutch, at worst it's a 1v3 ace clutch depending on if you count him killing the Harbor as a trade despite Harbor not killing his Breach. But technicalities suck for everyone so who cares?

Of course it is bannable
Yes, people were saying Tuesday

Rank reset normally causes the first act of the episode to have a wide range of players in the ranks just cause people don’t often play that much, sometimes it’s annoying af but the point of the reset is to not have rank decay like there is in csgo. If you can’t get to the same rank each episode then you didn’t deserve to stay in the rank
\*\*amp A has a spawnpoint at the east even if amp D is placed\*\*

Maybe it's because I'm not a woman but I never come across people that toxic. Even when there are women talking in vc. Nobody acts weird or toxic. I'm probably just extremely lucky. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
the numbers in the post are literally what % of ur kills are hs kills, if i wallbang someone 8 times w a stinger but finish them w a hs that number will be 100%, understand what ur looking at before u say mfs are cheating idk 😂
Yeah I’m sorry operators are terrible. I get “playing around it” but on certain maps/sites you can’t do that.

For example C site haven is so broken for an operator because even if you smoke the entire entrance to it  they still have angles they can hold for an easy picks

You shouldn’t have to dump loads of utility just to counter one player
Woohoojin also never said that it's impossible to climb to X rank with a shit setup, it's just a question of how much better you need to be than the average player in that rank considering your handicap.
Hi, do you know how to get name background of every agent ? Example DEADLOCK in the picture above

Cons: “Nothing there.”

It was so easy to go to your recent stuff, now it's a complete headache. Everything about the new locker system is so much worse now.
Hmm, I'm not sure. You could also just get an alt account to use whenever you play with them and then use your main when you're queueing w the ppl who aren't sus. You could also just ask and hope he doesn't take it that bad when you ask if they're cheating and since you're IRL friends I'd assume he won't lie to your face and risk all of your accounts getting banned which is just being a terrible friend.
I used to play with guy who had 15 smurf accounts, he used a spreadsheet to keep track. He'd ask us to pick a number between 1 and 15 and that's the smurf he'd use for the session. Anything less than 40 kills would be a bad game 

I was new at the time so I didn't think much of it.. but now? It's insane

It can make a difference in some cases, you will see certain things faster than another person running 60hz. In general I always recommend getting at least 120hz if your PC can support it because, at least for me, it's butter smoothe

Yeah that's honestly my biggest worry, that they keep adding characters and plot elements to the story without ever actually following up or resolving anything. Especially since I came from League, it's hard to have any faith in Riot to see a storyline to its completion instead of shelving stuff for all eternity.
While hs % is not the indication of being a good player but a strong hs % definitely shows that u r a precise aimer.

The bigger problem is that most people don't read anything except the name of the subreddit(not even flairs).
split and lotus aren't that bad. split is top tier imo. but lotus is really low-ranked unfriendly because of its unbalanced bombsites (A has much more room to play with as opposed to C where you just have to rush a chokepoint therefore fundementally requiring a lot of strategy on defense) and breeze is just well, breeze. morbidly obese in size and flows very unnaturally.
no
Kind of the same thing. I feel like I always shine on duelists because my movement/aim are good but I never play them because if I pick duelist we either gonna have no smokes or sent+initiator. Everyone locks duelist so it's kinda hard to play a normal game after u pick one which is kinda frustrating.

The buttons were redesigned for Mobile/Cloud Gaming UI. I prefer how it was before. White buttons with the letter colored the color of the button on your controller. It was more readable and recognizable before when they looked like (in my case) the actual Xbox controller buttons.
Pick a teammate and go with him. Peak together or trade him. Check the corner on his left if he is checking right or just forgets to check.

You will have to however accept that rank climb experience in valorant isn’t a straight up. It is a rollercoaster ride where you get to climb new highs only to fall back again.
I agree with you, but there is still a problem in valorant, and that’s smurfs/new account abusers. I know we’ve talked about that on this sub to no end, but there are still way too many lvl 5 reynas in casual games shitting on everyone. And those people are right there with the new players ruining games. And when they climb to a level where their mmr matches them against equal opponents nothing is stopping them from just making a new account and doing it all over again. 

I’ve been playing a lot of unrated over the holidays (akhem afk comp ban akhem) and almost every single game there is a below level 20 player destroying our team. Now I’m not the best but I’m still plat so I should be able to take on even ex CS players hopping on here (it’s not just aim, it’s utility usage being perfect and game sense on steroids too).
Vanguard needs a major fix and Smurfing needs to be banable as well. Blatant cheaters aren't so much the issue as people who toggle on and off to get an edge and win the game. It's starting to seem like Riot only cares about whether you say an adult word as an adult in an adult game and bans you for it. Which is sad considering this is literally an adult game, so why are they catering towards kids instead of banning people that ruin the game? 

Either way, I've only encountered ONE match that ended due to banning a cheater, and his mistake was making it super obvious, instead of doing what others do and toggling.

Thank you! Is unranked and competitive and stuff okay too ? Just because I enjoy those the most, I usually swap between swift play and competitive often. 

Also, what is spike rush ?? I’ve heard people talk about it but can’t find the mode anywhere. I’m on console, assuming it is not there quite yet.
Yeah ur not suppose to have high Kd if ur playing a duelist other than Reyna or iso.
Show a screenshot of your crafting recipes then "if they're yours"
That's the same thing happening to me unless I 3 stack or 5 stack
but having a bad smoker is worse than having no smokers. i remember watching my friend play in silver and his brimstone would insta smoke C long on haven every round. despite being told his teammate is holding an Op angle. and no the brim isnt trolling. ive seen omen players smoke inside the ground, smokes that are not flushed with the choke, smokes with gaps that give the opponents the advantage to sneak out.
I fucking hate that gun. Half the reasons to get full shield(the other one is guardian)
Valorant is very noob friendly, CSGO, Apex, and Arena shooters are all much more difficult to be good at
Hellot to anyone else on this train. Quite an enjoyable ride seeing someone misunderstand what muscle memory means while referring to aiming.
My bad sorry guys
I'd love this

That's my point! Players get mechanically better and develop new tactics, that's good.

In the same way, Viper moving her orb enabled important tactics. Raze double-satcheling into the back of a site is an important tactic. No one does it most rounds, but it's a threat you have to consider.
I feel like it should be free but I enjoyed it.

Yeah, unfortunately, this is common. Try to mute them and move on. If they start harassing in game, then report.

What I recommend is building out friends list to play with. It’s slow at first, but friend request the chill people. You might not play with them again, but at least it might be an option. (Make sure to given them a note to remember them) Over time, you’ll have at least one or two people to play with. It’s easier to manage assholes with a friend in the game.
It means a very short time. But maybe the server is down if it keeps saying that repeatedly
Yes I'm complaining cuz I dont get how sitting in a corner with a judge is fun...
Omen's cooldown is actually also 30 seconds so he still has better uptime.
Bro I shit you not there are trackers that show which skins people have. I have the champions phantom and heard people asking me for it before I’ve even whipped it out for the first time.
Cypher and no one is even close. Put more than half abilities on one site and rest in other with himself in corner, camera in mid and he has presence detection in whole map. As a Raze I hate that. Next is Sova.
Iso for the Longest Time didnt really feel like a Duelist to me, but now the Double Tap Rework gives Iso the Necessary Ability to Entry onto site with Confidence. As you said its really magical how this one change made Iso from the odd one out when it comes to Duelists. To a viable Option against High Damaging Team Comps and OP duels. 

Im excited to see how it plays ingame and cant wait to try it out.

Nobody is jump peeking main for the smoke either there’s no info. 1v5 in U vs sova omen phoenix who have all passed the smoke and have nowhere to go except dump util in there
riot is focused more on making esports titles
Change the ult to where left click fires it straight no matter what and right click tries to bounce it off of walls. This would make her ult feel a little more consistent to hit since the way it bounces it a bit confusing.
Agreed but at the same time I understand not even having the time to dupe let alone grind, And it’s extremely cheap from what I heard, Good way to waste a $20 bill for some instant pixels

It’s hard to fight an Odin if you don’t have good aim but using util like flash from a teammate is good but they’ll ussually spray when flashed making use of your dash to get out of there area of spray is important

I can't help. I can only carry. if you're interested, hit me up with your epic username.
It might be if you can also spend at least the same amount of time in the range, doing death matches, watching some vods of pro players that have similar play style to you or plays your favourite agent.

>Sorry I didn't hack into the private Chats of Rioters to actually find the real Reasoning for the current Map Pool.

Or just don't state a justification if you don't know their reasoning lol? You're not forced to guess what their justification is lmfao 

>You try to find them using some Logic you find... well... logical.

Following a line of logic and making up something are not mutually exclusive, you can follow a line of logic while making up a justification, again you did not get riot's justification you made your own  

Your logic probably followed something around the line of 

Riot doesn't want 2 maps with 3 sites -> both Lotus and Haven have 3 sites -> remove the older map to make space for the newer map 

You had to make up the idea riot doesn't want 2 maps with 3 sites and following from that line of logic you then made up the idea that Haven was removed for Lotus because they both have 3 sites and you assumed riot doesn't want 2 maps with 3 sites
But Valorant is my favorite game, I spend most of my free time on there, so, instead of by (more) drugs or beer, I buy some cool skins to drop when pic mid xD
Should be irrelevant. Mouse input is given to the game in counts, i.e. -2, 1, 5, and this is then multiplied with your sensitivity, so you never get an actually "round" input value. All orientation calculations are also done in floating point and there isn't really anything that differentiates round values from any other value.
According to the thousands of players who complain and witness smurfs daily smurfs are far more common than people like you "think".
Hard stuck iron lwk crazy ngl
That's why I built a whole pyramid mushroom to cover the top, because flingers aren't always that accurate. Even though they aim at the center, they might miss and the projectile enters the ATLAS directly lol.

But a pyramid mushroom thing aren't too useful because I can't put additional traps there. So what if, that center flat roof, instead of just one roof, I add 3 more? So one on the center as always, one to the west, one to the east, and one to the south. Then to the north, a wall launcher.

Of course, the wall launcher wall needs to be closer to the other ATLASes and away from the spawn area, so that it's not blocking the flinger's projectile path, if that makes sense.

I enjoy valorant only with friends. Playing in a team and using good callouts with some close friends is peak gaming for me. It takes us back to the days when we used to play sports but now we do it in the comfort of our homes. Competitiveness in things outside of sports is very unique to this generation and we’re loving it.

I wouldn’t say boring, but it does get annoying af when someone on my team says “omen you never smoke” when I use up my smokes for us to go into site and everyone just wants to hold hands right outside of site until my smoke runs out
Probably because ventures are the only interesting thing after beatimg the game

Do you have any link to see the animation ? Can't seem to find any video about the pistol
Headshot % can be a very misleading stat, especially when taken by itself. A low k/d with a high HS% tells me someones relying on aim to bail them out of bad positions or dry peeking. Along with this a low hs% but high kd could be someone who gets a lot of damage through smokes or is better at positioning themselves in winning situations then relying on their aim.

Or Astra “DOUBLE trinity, you’re welcome!” (Since “trinity” is her voiceline for a 3K).
Resetting a PlayStation to its Factory settings does not reset a PlayStation account nor an epic account. Fortnite is a server based game. Your save file is literally stored on Epics servers, not PlayStations, and not on your console. formatting your console would do nothing to your fortnite account.
No I checked. You replied to the wrong guy, I wasn’t saying anything like that. You’re just too lazy to check who you’re talking to. Reading comprehension, heard of that? Or like, reading at all for that matter…
The subreddit ranked FAQ has a section that talks about how double rank ups work.

the attachments look nice
the op puts me in charge of any situation I'm in.No bullshit spray mishap,not being useless in closerange (as opposed to shotguns) and many more

it makes sure that every mistake that happens is on my hands,and every success I harvest from it all the sweeter
Depends whether you like a light or heavy gun. I personally use the phantom more than the vandal but whenever I pick up a vandal skin that feels light I do better than when I'm using a heavy vandal skin. For example the kuronami feels way lighter than a reaver per say
Until the day that cross platform comes for comp (years at best, most likely wont ever happen) and pc and console ranks are made equal, console players will obviously be the inferior player, meaning their ranks mean much less than pc ranks. 

This isnt a bad thing, if console and pc ranks were equal to skill rn then the top 1% would be like silver, and most people would just not play cause of that
I don't really mind it. I just mute if someone is annoying. I think it's more fun to duo with someone you vibe with, but that can be hard with schedules and all that.
I chose raze cause I thought her blast packs were like trips and I wanted to play a defensive role 😭

what are you doing that is eating those up so fast?
This is the right answer I’m looking for.
I have a friend who's founders who only learned how to use squads. Please.
Exactly same for me and my third, but literally you can link Gamepass on account A, then say you wanna go to account B you can unlink from A and go straight to linking to B and now B will have all agents + 20%xp boost it’s really convenient
It’s “I couldn’t” care less. Maybe try and not be such a bot. Learn how to take some criticism. It’s not that serious.
I'm turning 40 and feel like I'm getting better.
The few toxic women I have met in this game are TOXIC. Much more than the men, and then if you clap back they say it’s because they’re a woman…


However 98% of the women I encounter are great. There are many more toxic men in the game

Nah I hard disagree. I don't see why jett wouldn't be lumped into the delete bin with that logic.  I'd wager Reyna is of similar importance during a group entry. 

Sure, people can play her selfishly. I've seen every agent place selfishly. I think having a confident fragger on Reyna is extremely useful. Personally, I like when the game is simplified down to shooter v shooter. I'd rather Reyna metas than Skye/cypher metas. It's a shooting game, I want to shoot.
Not my monitor I've replaced the console and still had this issue. IT'S LITERALLY THE TIRE TRAPS
I'm PL81. Not early game anymore😆😅😅
Well yeah that is kinda what I said.

It just is so weird to me that some people associate their actions with themselves to such a degree. Just because I said “that’s a stupid push” doesn’t mean I said “ur stupid” lmao, that’s 2 completely separate things .
You are arguing against children. Most people on this subreddit are teenagers. You cannot win against them.

Oh so now I'm supposed to not judge people off their looks. Smh how do people feel so insulted over misgendering an actual fictional character?

People used to call me as madam whenever I picked up the phone when I was young and I am a guy ? So am I supposed to feel insulted over it ?

Bruh. So I should consider a transgender woman as a trans and not a woman ? Fine.
Bro why am i getting nostalgia.....
As far as I know, viper + cypher is still the go to meta with viper anchoring on a site with wall and cypher solo holding b site.

It's any competitive community. I was in another game's subreddit a while back and after I gave an opinion, someone asked for my tracker. They said my opinion didn't matter unless I was high elo, (which I actually was, unlike in Valorant haha).
For God's sake fix Shockwave on Soldiers, Dragon Slash on Ninjas and if there are any other vital broken abilities, fix them too. PLEASE. MY SHOCKWAVE WORKS 1 out of 10 times , especially when jumping.

This is perhaps an unpopular take, but I think they should revert the ult/headhunter nerfs and keep the trip/TP bad. I've always thought of Chamber's guns as the cornerstone of his kit, as was Riot's wording for what they thought of Phoenix's flash and ult.

+1 for Galorant. I am guy, so I don't have any personal experience, but I've only heard good things about them. There's also a screening process to filter out any creeps who pretend they are a girl. Should be a pretty wholesome and safe space for anyone afraid to play alone.
What buff does to a mf.
muted
Yeah I understand it's frustrating but I have heard some vile shit on comms in Valorant. People just get tired of hearing stupid people. I've see my friend get verbally abused 3 games in a row for being a woman and just be like "well I'm done with pub comms" and we only talk in party. If you think about sometimes you get more Intel if you don't speak. Like if you're a woman and 3 games in a row you had people turn into shitheads when they found out your a woman you are going to quit talking. If the manchild doesn't get triggered by hearing a woman's voice she doesn't have to mute him and can still get intel. You should be mad at the people who can't just make call outs and feel the need to bring up someone's gender, sexual orientation race etc in a derogatory way.

notice how i said “in my opinion.” they’re still low elo players and there’s a good amount of people who can agree that they are. idc who’s above or below me, it’s low elo to me; go watch actual diamond gameplay and see how terrible their gameplay is.

they’ve literally added ascendant because there was such a huge gap in diamond and immortal player skills. im sure they’ll add another rank eventually too.
It's hard to know, because it depends on your playstyle. My main is cypher since the beta. I'm immortal 3 and I just love Cypher. It fits almost onto every map. Harbor is another agent which I picked up lately, I play him a lot. I like gekko a lot as well and Reyna (if soloq/duoq ranked). If it's match day, Reyna is bad. 

Omen is a decent pick up as well. The learning curve is easier with agents who don't have line up options. But in the end, you will have to learn line ups with some of the agents and it's highly dependent on the meta. Current meta favors Cypher big time. I highly recommend that one. The other one, it's up to you. Chamber used to be OP back then, nowadays, not so much.
Hopefully the wiki helps that problem. 

There's a lot of posts that complain about parts of the ranked system that either don't exist or dont function how they assume, but there's **plenty** to discuss/criticize once you learn how it works.

iron 2 diamon 3
definitely the scariest one coming from the other team
Honestly just fix the game
Yep me and everyone ik online has the same issue
Seems reasonable. Only times I almost used up my ammo was when spamming smokes lol. They’re clearly trying to nerf that a bit, especially because it’s boring to do and boring to watch.
Diamond 2 with 12% as well. My aim is AWFUL.
I mean he has better HS than other bronzes / iron against other bronze / Iron movements but if he has 28% HS on vandal he could go much higher with a normal (even high) sens
Thank you very much
you're just lazy in those terms then
Are u playing vs players with high ping perhaps? Try changing servers. 
You can also view your CPU + GPU latency in-game, but I'd say it's most likely below 10ms.
I just pick an agent and if they get toxic aboit I’m either like “who asked?” Or “deal with it it’s An agent I like to play and I’m comfortable with” that usually shuts them up about it lol (I don’t play ranked but when I did I peaked silver 1 if that matters Lmfaoo)
People are weird on the internet. More news at 9.

You unironically use the word dweeb. You're just as weird as the people you're complaining like a child over 💀
There is this new setting we're your PC gives the info direct to valo instead. Without this setting IT gives the Infos to Windows and Windows gives the Info the valo, this setting isbnot that Long in the Game so maybe u do not have it activated at ur alt acc
Omen ult now comes with Jett knives
It's so rare
What does this mean?it isn't rational that the team with 5 can draw if they want but the team with 4 can,I see what your trying to say but I've been in the situation of the 4 player team in ot and trust me when I say that every time it happens I've lost it,and every time we would have drawn, it's more unfair for the 4 players then the 5 players

The point of the rank reset is to crunch everyone back down. Radiants get put all the way back down at Ascendant, so everyone else has to get crunched down as well. Generally that means going down 1 to 2 ranks. You actually got out pretty decently by landing on the bottom half of that.
ye the valorant support said the same thx
dude its 8 games😐
I also enjoy a bit too much Valorant sometimes, I feel like as soon as you get too emotional about it, or you prioritize it over things that you once valued a lot, you need to stop. Let him know you're there for him and suggest getting some help to tackle this addiction together.

The Fortnite Big Bang event was themed around the muktiverse, your player character was tossed between various realities before being catapulted to the space between universes. Among the recognized ones were Lego, Rocket Racing (Rocket league), and this one people are saying is STW.
You really nailed the eyes and hair.
I main skye and viper, I usually get around 15-20 assists on skye and mid-frag at the gold - plat level. Sometimes I get lucky, I get kills with my dog. Comms is very important when playing skye, time it properly and you basically get a guaranteed kill.
Imagine thinking I don't have one ❤️
Good luck not getting swung and shot in the time it takes to throw it.
sadly no... i'm simply replying to the ones that is setting the example of what i clearly stated.
CEF's work from two tiles high, and cover more area - place them one higher for best effect.
This is so low rank how will you get enough players
I'm fine with it

Had to delete most of them, though, since they were duplicates, and it wouldn't let me overwrite a lot of them, so instead of 200 presets, it's around 130.
Lol I guess my silver elo is showing 😅  I don't play Raze at all, was just using pro play and my own experience as a base for my thoughts. Based on what they said in the release video it does seem like they are going to scale back her mobility, cause that seems to be the main complaint along with ult being too easy to get online. I'm interested to see what changes they make. Hopefully we see more Neon and Phoenix, I'm just getting bored of the constant Jett and Raze picks in pro play.
don't recall seeing it either, but I haven't used these traps in years

I wouldn't mind it if it worked correctly. Not being able to spot  hacks that a human eye can see is sad. 

What I'm referring to is the Kernal Hacks tuned to just make your aim a better enough so that you don't look extremely suspicious to the lobby you're in. Kernal hacks are hard to detect, but being a Kernal Level anti-cheat, I'd expect a bit more out of it.
This should be seen in microsoft account settings under "order history"

I played this morning after waking up having some coffee and playing with the dog outside. I know that playing tired makes you play worse and I usually never binge valorant. I usually get off after 1-3 games or at least swap games.
damn loads of people been having this problem today, seems like Riot is locking people out of getting them before the kingdom store even comes out
See how many creds you’ll have next round if you buy full. If you buy full on a save round and lose and don’t have enough to buy on your teams buy round, you are hurting your team. This happens a lot in low elo where people absolutely refuse to eco and force everything they can every round.
Use voice comms if you're not already. Comm all useful info you can. Too many players don't comm enough. If you're losing try to hype up your team. Try to keep the peace if other teammates are fighting. That and what others say (warm up, don't play too much) can go a long way.
My friend unfortunately had to experience the same thing

Since it says HB SSD 1, you can’t do it if you already did

People are way too mean about minima, I think it actually looks decent
lets see how many things we got here

1 team players, names and health top left  
2 next to player named: server info, ping, and coordinates (right? right)  
3 top middle timer  
4 top right mini map  
5 next to mini map, effects?  
6 next to effects?: FPS and more coordinates? (i dont know)  
7 mid left we got quests  
8 bottom left player health and shield  
9 on top of that a log of events  
10 to the right of health some machine set up buttons?  
11 to the bottom right abilities and item bar  
12 and on top of that the materials bar

thats... 12 things in the hud!
I can’t message could you message me please
This, especially the self worth part is something people need to learn. Please dont think you are a worse person because you bottom frag in gold. Not even in radiant. Radiant #1 goes to mcdonalds pays as much as an iron player. Doesnt matter.
? telling them not to buy the botted accounts and ruin iron games is bad?

no one is saying they can't play, just play in ur own rank. 

do ur ranked challenges, just hand level an account to 20. 

content creator could play unrankeds or swiftplays with viewers to level those accounts or something. 

keeoh does that & he gets into ascendant/immortal lobbies in a couple games.

it's not like their life is ruined from that change... 

obv the bot problem needs a fix too. that's on the riot team.

I only play sentinel, so Im gonna instalock it...unless u are a cypher 1 trick with cringe setups, I know I will do my role right. When I see how some KJs put down their turret and dont even play off it...it hurts my soul.
> I find a knife skin to be worth 50 bucks????

Yeah. Other people find a brand symbol to be worth much more and it doesn't add anything to the cloth they wear. Again otheres buy those 5-10 games on a steam sale and play only one of them for an hour.

I personally have spend around 400€ for a knife skin irl lol. Got myself an expensive japanese knife that probably doesn't perform much better than a 100€ one but looks great and I never regreted it. I love cooking and spend multiple hours a week doing it so why not have a nice knife then.

I also love valorant and spend around 1000 hours playing it, so why shouldn't I get myself some skins that make me enjoy those hours more?

Prople earn money and spend it on things they like or things to show of with. So what? Why is that a problem to you?

  


> Companys can do this bc there are always idiots who buy it.

Oh no, companies can offer a free game to you and still make money because people are willing to buy skins. How awful. The world would be so much better if Valorant would work on a subscription model to make money insted of optional skins :( /s
I don't understand how someone can claim transphobia when a transgender person has not been attacked. It's a freaking kj turret. I'm multilingual and I'm telling you it sounds abnormal. It also doesn't exist in other languages

Yeah I got immortal 3 and just haven’t been able to pick up the game at all. I went from enjoying the grind to just loathing the game as soon as I hit a new peak. I remember doing the same thing when I hit diamond for the first time a few years ago.
If you want to sell a fake, it's best to have a duelist and initiator together to fake it.
It doesn't matter how large a company is when they gotta pump out content at such a rate. And, yes, they are forced to keep the same pace of every two weeks to leep the community at bay. Everyone already freaks out about "content drought" during their summer and winter holidays when they leave the game alone for just a little longer, let alone doing that regularly.

Her profile picture is still near the bottom on the far right, you might wanna cover that
And he's iron too... Of course.
Initiators with exception of Sova(kinda) should not lurk, if a sova has lineups I could be persuaded to let them lurk, some duelists should lurk, yoru and Reyna being great examples, controllers that can help from a distance like viper or omen can lurk as well as kj and cypher being good lurkers. I’m an omen main and really enjoy lurking as I can throw smokes from basically the entire map and get some really cheeky rotate kills that help my teammates back on site
The tracker on the Milinium Falcon is the reason for the bad shots.
Bro you are on Reddit hating women you are the biggest loser in society. Does your mom know you hate women? I would say gf but it’s obvious to everyone and irl that you don’t have one. Pathetic sad self hating loser. Also the majority of Val players are iron and bronze maybe silver so your comment is irrelevant.
1. One tricking an agent is helpful short-term and detrimental long-term. It's helpful in that you know the ins and outs of your agent and how they play against other agents and comps. You'll know how to play every map a certain way and be able to contribute no matter what, especially as a smokes player. It becomes detrimental when you don't know how to play any other way than your own. If you're suddenly thrust into playing a different role it'll be difficult for you to adapt. I'd recommend playing at least 1 agent from another role. Since you're smokes you'll probably be able to adapt to a sentinel playstyle more easily.
2. Exclusively playing smokes, out of any other role, is probably the best thing you can do for player development. As a smokes player, you have to know the ins and outs of a map meaning your awareness should be impeccable. You're also directing the team to fight specific angles with the way you place your smokes, so you're going to need to learn what fights are favorable to you and your team. In other words, as the smokes player, you are also partially the IGL and need to have or attain good game sense.
3. No, not really. But if you see yourself run into vandals more often than phantoms, it would benefit you since vandal is 4 shots to the body regardless of whether you are running light or heavy shields. 
4. Crosshair placement, spatial awareness, knowing when to hide and when to fight, playing for objective > kills.
Don’t let them know your next move?
Obsidiana is one of my favorites, can't believe I missed it
I LOVE CHRONOVOID it’s so good and clean for no reason
Breach in high*
That was a closing statement you didn't need to respond to but ok
I actually like his chill personality a lot more than the overtly confident nature of the other agents. Hes chill as fuck and doesnt make constant loud statements about how cool he is. I really appreciate that type of personality especially considering his role in the game lmao
In 0-3m fights spray and move, in 3-8 spray, 10-15 burst and dropshot, (often first tap, then re adjust, and dropshot tap) anything more do a combo of mainly strafe and tap, with crouch as more of a rare mix up. This is a good formula to follow until the super high elos that 95% of us won’t hit. These examples are also just for 1v1 fights, full health, in a vacuum.
Not on reddit though

feel free to update me, i'd be happy to see it!
I play solo unless I’m playing with friends. I don’t expect people to play exactly like me lmao, there are thousands of ways to properly trap, everyone in my regular group has their own way of doing things, yet oddly enough spamming ceiling zappers and calling it a day is not on the list of options

POV: scared teammate justifying camping in main
I / ONLY / play Chamber.
lol ur funny man, all I’m saying is if riot wanted to do something about it they would. Writing an essay on reddit isn’t gonna accomplish anything
I feel bad that you are getting so many downvotes just because you are a new player who does not know the game and agents that well
Unfortunately no, I made sure the agent names are right, I turned on the Auto loader

But nah they don’t work, although sometimes it does look like it did but only on certain weapons, the Ghost Phantom Vandal and Melee did match the loadout once, but I guess it was coincidence cuz others didn’t match
Requesting agents in selection is bait. If your in silver I wouldnt trust a teammate to play anything, let alone an agent with flashes.

As a yoru 1 trick in ascendant, just play to hold site. Someone will swing you, you kill them. Don’t reposition, just wait for the next guy to swing you. I did it in silver and it worked for me.
ehhh it’s one of the games that has a higher female player base than others . then you mix bloodthirsty males with them and you get many e-couples

i don’t mind it. there are bigger issues in the world
Thank you, it wasn't intentional tho. I just ignored it long enough and happened to complete it 😅😅
Nah, they are just a loser.
Does anyone have a code for US or EU? 🥺 I keep trying but I can’t get one
Nah. As sad as it is, ppl probably did go to him originally since he advertised himself as a "radiant coach". False advertising and lying should always be called out.
man they really killed omen off :/
😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
Ofc I'm literally an iron but I'm complaining about the ppl in the rank not belonging there
Yes, a skye, an omen, a chamber, a neon, and prob a reyna. Time for me to rank below iron 1
Smurfing exists for a reason. If it didn't matter, they wouldn't smurf.
Sucks cause my power was out for a few days I didn’t get to do them 💀 lol what was the thing they gave out this year or is it better to not know?
Why did you left out my explosive swede boi? I mean he's a recognised criminal from a criminal family.
Just so you know you can’t get more frames than your computer can put out in hz, all that frames per second stuff is useless above the hz limit. That’s exactly why 360hz monitors cost 1k+
NA
respect to you for not really playing the round with game-given wallhacks. you’re a better person than 98% of the player base who’d have abused it and then talked shit
fuck that excuse at this point. They knew damn well from the get-go what was expected to the point where they literally adressed the concern before the game even officially released and our riding on that reasoning/excuse just reinforces the idea that its okay for them to actually take 6 years because thats what we're "expecting of them".

They made this game from the ground up with esports in mind and the fact that they cannot provide such a basic feature KNOWING how vital something like that is is entirely appalling. Literally NO excuse at this point.
Valorants MMR system is dogwater. I was silver 3, and I carried plats in my team. I'm not even a smurf, and it's crazy why I only play against players two tiers above me.
Just annoyed they left in breeze...
She outlines like sova so she’s strong against smokes. With a good smokes teammate or against a smokes heavy team, she’s great.  I duo with a brim so on haven, I haunt while defending A haven in heaven and get free snipes from inside a smoke.
Which skin?
Don't give up it'll feel very difficult at first, but the more you play you'll understand the maps and it'll become second nature

A good tip for you is when you're aiming, regardless of if you're just moving around the map, always have your crosshair positioned at the head level in case an enemy unexcepted comes into your view, it might be the reason you stay alive.

Good luck :)
i connected to my old epic account and there’s nothing on my fortnite locker yet i had over 300 skins?
200, 2 premium knives 1 prem classic 1 prem phantom 1 prem vandal. Wouldve gotten a spectre but dont like the design of spectres.

Completely unrelated but, I've Litteratly never seen anyone else but me own Lucien west before so it's nice to see I'm not actually alone!
I used to play 1600 1.25 lmao
and the phoenix ult too haha
I will try thanks
If you can make it, do check your llama shop and [FortniteDB.com](https://FortniteDB.com) daily. The Stormblade shows up quite often.
oni for both
So we’re in iron
could be low immortal too, it's not that rare to see a full team peaking you 1 by 1
Go to r/FortNiteBR and ask again!
My servers are NA West Cali mainly. That's true it really does depend on your region for what time people's demon hours start
Solid call outs are always welcome, but backseat gaming is ridiculously distracting and I tend to mute people quickly
It smells bad :(
Yeah If the Reyna is losing a lot of 50s or  more likely just taking bad 50s(random swings with no coordination or util)  thenthat sucks. But that’s a player issue, same shit would happen If they’re playing a duelist.

U gotta win some of your 50s without your own util as other duelists too often. You need coordination with your team util. And sometimes you lose it but if you are tradeable/made space/opened up site then it’s ok if you die
Just happened again. Now I'm downloading 57.4 gigs...

Whatever happened to "smart" updates that only updated the files with changes? How are companies still so bad at this?
Cypher has the funniest voicelines and the trolliest kit. Throw a trip and a cage and get a free kill? Pure dopamine. So that's why I love playing him.

Okay I don’t mean this in a racist at all, but I work at a community college and I noticed a lot of foreign people from mostly Asian countries can be kinda rude because they are taught the life style of “survival of the fittest” or “no one is going to help you but yourself.” Also common in old people
man of culture right there
It's just a psychological trick. Think about it this way if you dress up in your best outfit, you will feel confident. The gun works the same way. it's just that confidence is a big part in aim.
It sucks you had to go through that, and I know its tough when your only options are as you said, to feel like you have to silence yourself to handle it.

There are some female exclusive communities, such as galorants, if you want to look for people with similar experiences.

You shouldn't have to silence yourself, no one with any decency would defend that kind of behaviour
Yeah this subreddit will NOT admit it though. 

There is no other fps where you can see as many people as there are here being completely and utterly lost as to why they are so inconsistent and why they "cant find the right sensitivity"  or why "sometimes I just randomly lose all my skill and its like I cant even react to the enemy who peeks and kills me, in what seems like 0.1 ms)   


I have a horrible feeling its intentional because you can put every god damn stat graph on the screen and it gives you no info to what is obviously a netcode/desync error.
[removed]
That is very optional, and very much depends on the situations.
1000 euros give or take. No reason to regret it. If i get 10 hours of enjoyment from New skins i’d consider it worth it
I need a lot more details like damage values the ult should reflect more of a samurai like he can dash straight forward  dealing damage in a wide like the closer the stronger the damage is with a short animation so he can be countered but saved by good communication and teamwork
I don’t play Iso enough to answer fully but I use his wall as entries when there are two places enemies could be peaking entry. In breeze you can wall B to the left to block where most people wait for people to walk into site. You can also use it to get close to enemies if you push it towards them and walk with it considering you can’t shoot through it, it could give you a bit more of an advantage. I personally don’t use his vulnerability power much though as it’s very thin and you can’t always accurately guess where the enemies are in order to make them vulnerable.
Silver gotta be. Played against gold Reynard and would've died taking that angle
I started playing csgo, then played valorant, then switched back to csgo just for a while

and by habit I typed nt in chat after a round and I got vote kicked
>Recently I went on a 20 game loss streak, being team MVP or match MVP in every one.

I bet my left nut this did not happen. Drop the tracker my boy.
one thing i liked about valorant was they changed the maps and added characters to update the game. i don’t like when games like valorant change the ui and things like that to the point where it doesn’t even feel like the same game and then people miss the old ui and things like that. they should definitely give an option to change it or not.

Well predatory pricing is when the big competitor squeeze competition out of business by setting very low prices, often to short-term detriment. You're probably not referencing this definition but... How can riot be predatory to consumers? You don't need skins to play the game.

So in your ideal, riot should allow all skins to be purchased at all times?
Yes. It's because they got rid of daily rewards for us founders
I'm guessing you're a BR player that keeps hearing the TMNT sound.

Not sure what's causing it but you're not the only one.

Imagine if they're like this in real life where the men enter women's WC because they can't read whats written on signs and vice versa
It's a pretty cool game with guns, you should check it out.
if i cant find the friends if they were in a 5 stack i will solo ofc
It could also be cheaters using discord bots...

They don’t due to an exploit relating to that afk protection.

Plus pepple got annoyed about it whilst doing things like following a guide for an endurance build.
I wonder what the ranks of those people who say reyna can't get immortal are lmfao, gonna guess silver or below
No lol, I've been grinding hard and have a decent gaming setup but still stuck in iron
Edited my comment because I did forgot to mention that undercut is shit at clearing corners.

Ok, for the wall and shield. You are a Iso entering B on Lotus, you wall in front of you stopping and you only have to clear the right side while you have a advantage
Well I felt fairly proud of the clip and wanted to show people, I felt that my performance in this clip was better than my rank so I thought I would ask people what they thought to give me a bit of an ego boost lol. Besides, people seem to like looking at clips in the subreddit as a whole so I figured it’s a win win.
Though a lot of players don’t realise over aggression is their biggest flaw in lower elo. That said if you’re team is going you need to go to. Taking an unfavourable fight with your whole team is much much better than thinking well this is an unfavourable fight I’ll just let 3 of my teammates push in and definitely lose it rather than taking the fight with your whole team
I named mine when I was like 8, we named it "the coolest headquarters"
I have 7 matches on Breeze this act and I haven't won a single one lol
Good to know thanks. But I’d also like to be a bit delusional and think I deserve it too lol
Honestly it's just her kit that's doesn't really fit in teams.
The only buff she can get it's if they replace her heal with a tp, the wall with a trip that's slow enemies, instead of a wall give her an guardian-like weapon, and her ult would be an op that upon killing, Puts a slow!
Here's my take on this situation.. it means round 1 on both half is going to be more important than round 2. Nobody should be saving at all round 1. *OR* the complete opposite will occur where it will be more advantageous to save round 1 in preparation for round 2 to buy it. It means either round 1 or 2 of each half will be basically a free round for a while. Until the community finds the sweet spot with this thing
I think grenades earned a bad rep early on, and everyone gave up on them too early. Master granadier ramirez with the right loadout is a monster in ventures, and compliments constructors well even in 160s
True yea I definitely got them confused
tik talk
I am glad some new people have fun encountering bugs
usually to play with some friends.

Im not really good but im ascendant, i have not a single friend on the same rank as mine and since I dont really care about my rank in this game because its not my main game, i would play with them in my main (even tho it only allows it if we have a full party), but they do complain a lot because the enemy team will be much better than what they are used to, so i have another account with much lower rank for when i want to play with them. 

Usually when i play with them, I dont play it much serious,  but i do have much better aim and moves than golds and plats. So yeah i feel bad but this is the way we found out to play together.
Fuckin finally
This should improve sometime in the next week. We are aiming to try and get Paris, London and Madrid back down however because of our network topology, it might be a few ms higher than before as we run Cairo into Milan first for redundancy reasons.
Hello ! Of course, I'm starting tomorrow with the skin mode!
Now it’s better lol
Just a total lie lol.
Yeah, at that level and your age... it's not the age
Vandal is only better if you’re good at one tapping in the head. Otherwise Phantom is superior imo.
This sub is for the zombie pve mode, battle royale is r/fortnitebr
It's not that deep bro just like average game knowledge lmao
While eating pigs in a blanket in a blanket.
they are iron after 3years of playing lmao

they clearly dont care about improving and shouldnt care about wining, just let them have fun and dont go comp with them
I mean I feel you but the thing with fiction is someone can always come up with some reason, even if the rest of us think it’s a dumb one.
Muting after they are toxic can somtimes fuck up you up even more. Whenever you know you made a mistake, in your mind you think they are talking shit about you while in reality they didn't even say anything.
The Valorant maps have a lot of potential when they don’t need to serve the needs of gaming.  I would love to see more reinterpretation like this version of Split-

https://youtu.be/6x5-DC4xNRM?si=c6S6w6LGvlwWJS9V
There's so much you can do better here, but we can't exactly pinpoint that if you're playing against lower rated opponents. just say you want to show off an ace, if you had any intentions of improving you should be posting a compilation of you dying and asking why, not posting an ace in an unrated game vs silvers
She is super oppressive in pro. If you have proper coordination (like in pro teams), you can effectively control an entire site/portion of the map *without even being there* 

She’s mid in ranked because most people aren’t really playing the same game
You’re sexy
WHJ x Voltaic is Plat and above no?
Useless tips if your aim is bad. Sounds like you were just someone who rages all the time if you were actually hard stuck gold 1 and these tips helped you
My first thought xD
There are no definition like "rat". It was made up by upset people. If your win strategy is holding a site, it is the thing that you should do.

Definitely, there are no shame in holding sides. Use your tools in the best way to provide win to your tram and to you.
LOL
Buddy they hella mad and don’t know coms
Uninstall and reinstall
Peekaboo
> in-game stability

Most people won't notice or care about dropping from 400FPS to 200, and if the drops are greater than that then there are other issues to be worrying about.

> less fan noise

If you care enough then sure.
Considering this is a beta, and the first one they’ve done, my guess is they’re just testing the servers before allowing you to play with people in other regions, give them time
How did he rank fairly high when he’s iron and there is a bronze in his lobby?
Save the world is on life support. It won’t be around and playable long enough to ever be worth 4k
Judge + smokes. I love going up against ops.
Depends.

I guess your Unrated MMR has a huge influence on your first competitive placement matches. 

My friend was matched into Gold lobby in his first competitive match and he was completely destroyed. So, yeah. It depends how you are doing on your Unrated games.
Bro is buying two borderline meaningless tps instead of having 2 smokes as omen 💀
I see, thanks!
That’s mean you being carried. You’re lucky enough if your team is popping off but if it’s the other way around, then you wont climb.
HS% isn't as important as some people make it out to be
They’re downvoting you but you’re right. You won’t see her played in higher ranks for that exact reason. Pros will make strategies eventually and then us common people will use her but picking her right now is still trolling the lobby

We’ll just have to wait and see
Op i was like you, 40 fps 10 on medium bots, now i can get 20 and 100 fps using razor cortex, it helps alot (not with aim tho, thats just practice)
That's pretty good coordination then, you are on a good path
No, because his videos reeked of ego, especially a bit before the Radiant Coach fiasco. He hates when someone judges his decisions and gets really mad. Keep in mind his videos are edited so he could cut out or edit these parts to not look as much of an egoistic guy. That's what the above comment said.

I don't know how you came to the conclusion that he's a narcissist because he edits videos...
What
Yes because that’s how the game works. Someone’s bound to have a good game in every 10 person lobby especially in lower ranks where utility and team cohesion just isn’t worried about. Everytime you play a game 5 people will win 5 people will lose and some will do well some will do ass.
Mann I can’t believe you are able to use the Ares over it, I do see what you mean but I can’t aim with the Ares for the life of me compared to the Spectre 😂
Updraft nerf is deserved imo, since she has the hover/glide passive, which sort of combines with updraft (like neons movement and slide)
For me its the opposite, it was the first skin i bought and i hate it. Something about the way it feels like its tilted upwards makes me aim like shit.
Sorry to be that guy, but being stuck in plat is never, ever a gear issue.
I love kurinami
yup, still has more players than any of the new modes released this chapter
Yay

Its the lesgue of legends world finals song for this year. AKA the biggest work of music that riot games has produced this year. If someone likes all of riot’s games, then it makes sense for them to use this song.
It only bans you if you do a certain amount of team damage or kill a teammate right at the beginning of the round. It’s very hard to get banned for team damage on accident.
CONGRATS!! i’ve had no time to play lately 😔 gotta get back on it

yeah I was playing unrated when this Reyna and yoru just started teaming with the enemy team and start trolling we managed to get 10-10 before the yoru just kept on flashing us and grabbing spike and running
No for real. No one want 30 maps out at the same time. No one care about that.


Rotating map is just fine for like 99% of people.
My first match is my warmup (don’t do that)

I will say if you have ult up she is good in the clutch. I also wonder if they buff her further they could make the equip on her ult faster. Might be broken but I sometimes have died equipping it cuz it’s a bit slow.
nope! aha to be fair though, I’ve played stw many times but i haven’t played consistently enough to actually finish the event till now (i dropped the game half way through) so i never noticed. i only found out through a reddit comment, and it’s because of this issue ^^ that i never even noticed, i thought they were just randomly added for a few months. same with the big throwing zombies, but i haven’t seen them in a while
Today I also got selected to do a survey for a chance to do a remote playtest and I've been questioning what it's for.
copy and paste the code
2/10, 68.2% KAST is abysmal
Duelists duel for space, initiators initiate fights. 

For example, compare Gekko vs. Skye (flash initiator) with Gekko vs. Phoenix (flash duelist). 

Gekko and Skye are much more similar in that their abilities primarily gather information and help their teammates scale onto site, and though they can also make use of their own abilities, it isn't the most optimal way to play the agents. Their ultimates also focus on helping teammates get value, rather than the agents themselves. They are more valuable in terms of surviving later in the round because their utility is valuable in retake or post-plant situations.

Phoenix is very different from these two because his kit is built to get him onto site and take the most important engagement: the first fight. His flashes have virtually no range, his wall is short and doesn't last very long, and his ultimate enables him to aggressively take space. His molly heals himself while harming teammates, because he is supposed to be running into site and getting shot up, rather than sitting in the middle of his team and healing them in a radius.
did you read the freaking requirements - he doesnt allow more than 2 games of filling in last 20 games
Gold 2!
It's destroying the game along with W-key bots (I have had 3 in the same lobby...) throwers and leavers. Half the games aren't competitive anymore. 

It's not a competitive shooter anymore, it's a lottery for who gets the smurf and doesn't get the other trash on your team.

(Winning with a smurf on your team isn't fun either....)

Why would wide swinging be considered triggering? I wide swing every angle cuz thats how i think every dm should be played, taking a 50/50 over trying to make a situation 60/40. But yea using an easy gun with bad gunfight hygiene is the main reason why i get angy in dms. Recently ive just been turning up the music, looking at the minimap less, and not walking at all. Helps me focus solely on my mechanics and gunfight hygiene while im also not getting tilted. Im a strong believer that this is the right way to play dms but to each their own. Like if you queue up a dm id expect you to want to work on gunfight hygiene, so why would you go a weapon that involves little to no movement? Nobody needs to practice using an odin, the only thing you need to know is how to use the weapon (immobile, spray weapon) and you will do amazingly well against most team comps in ranked. Though this is why i just play tdms now rather than dms
give me one bro plss
Another man of culture. The champions vandal is great. And tbh best finisher in the game.
If you look closely, you can see she walks into the edge of the nade, and only after the main nade explodes. Only then does she seem to be closer to the middle, but that's only because the second, mini nades are extending.

So yes, she was at the edge, you asked, if you don't like the answer then that's on you, it's no bug, the nade just wasn't in your favour that round aka valorant timing.
anti air is good for lobbers

discharger kills smasher very good

and than you can just focus on the flingers, and ignore the boss...
not really  
it's team responsibility when team decide to entry together  
duelist go first after initiator and controller use their util

if no one follow then entrying is wasted, just go take space somewhere else  
go lurk and catch enemy, do whatever, like split entry
Ya don't bother. One on hand you have Valve who say things like EasyAC supports Linux and it's just turning on by flipping a switch. Then you hear, "oh my god linux is soooo hard", from Epic who really just don't want to put the work into it. Then you have people like Pirate Software a person who's got 20 years of experience saying things like, you don't need kernel level anti-cheat. Don't even bother with it. Just find out what they are doing an ban then.  Then finally, you have games like Apex who has kernel level anti-cheat and the game is STILL rampant with cheaters. So in the end, it's not a real argument. And how exactly is "it was different when it was just Steam"? They are doing more now then ever between Steam, the backend, all their hardware projects? What? Just because they made games trying out different kinds of monetization like every other company has that makes them automatically bad? Come on.
I wish, i really can't justify any money spent on this game even if it's my most enjoyed game.
They are suppose to be making changes after Shanghai masters, but dude the whole episode has been cooked honestly. It's like every act has been riddled with bugs and server issues for me that makes it impossible for me to play comp and do well. Last night was the first night that I didn't really have any issues except for the occasional poor hit reg, and its basically night and day. Need a big fix at the end of this act to bring in the next episode.
Does the pc version support controllers? Or is it even worth it to use a controller against mouse and keyboard players?
agreed and i don't even think comp should be limited to the pro map pool either. It gets so boring playing the same maps back to back and it happens often when there's only 7 maps.
It’s been 3 month I wait for the prelude to chaos vandal I thought it was long but when I saw a content creator on TikTok that waited 350 days to have the rgx vandal he share his journey every single day till like 3 weeks ago he finally got his rgx
At the end of the day, if you enjoy guardian and like staying in bronze, that's all that matters.
funny thing, you can get to radiant without paying a single cent for a skin
U know that u can mute her right ?
I will always give Gekko a chance with the spike to start the game, but if he clearly has absolutely no idea what he’s doing with it and losing us rounds then the team takes it away.
Can u just put them in here and some people get it
Man Valorant fanart fucks, you guys are insanely talented

I peaked at Gold 2.  Last season I didn't get above Silver 3, and this season not above Silver 1, currently on Bronze 3.  I'll have a few good games, get between 17 and 30 RR.... then I'll have 3 or 4 games where one guy on the enemy team has more kills than everyone else combined and I lose 20-30 RR every time.  The smurfing in this game has reached almost unplayable levels... that said, I honestly believe I have not improved much beyond what I started at.  I know the levels better, I have better game sense - but my aim hasn't really improved, and even if using aim trainers helps, I don't have the time for it.  I see nothing wrong with playing within my own rank except that other people ruin that by smurfing.  I don't mind losing a very close game... I see red when it is a 2 - 13 railroading by one or two people on the opposing team.  Especially when they add insult to injury by being toxic and telling you you're trash.
I smoke and drink very often and still queue ranked on my main account. You need to learn to let go of that imaginary number next to your rank
This is hard for me to accept that she improved from iron all the way to silver because of quality of life changes. I started the game at iron and for me to get to even bronze I had to improve things like my crosshair placement. So no I think your friend has been doing more than just what you claim
as an avid astra enjoyer, and also a controller main since beta, the only times i didnt play astra was right after her big nerfs (since i was climbing and keeping with the meta) and currently cause clove gets instalocked

before clove i used to pick astra almost every other game

imo she is very unique and fun to play and while most people play her like a controler/sentinel hybrid, i play her more like an controller/sentinel/initiator hybrid

being able to plan smokes and stuns allows for a fun playstyle of timing your own util for your own pushes
I mean, sometimes, but less common with duos. As I was ranking up, I've encountered so many duos with one smurf, one boosted, where the smurf encouraged the boosted player to instalock an agent like Reyna or Jett while they played a support agent like Sage, and then they proceeded to do awful AND simultaneously be toxic to the rest of the team/lobby.
This article has a breakdown of what ranks can queue together.

https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047937633-VALORANT-Competitive-Mode-FAQ
I'm confused simply because defusing makes a noise... wouldn't Sage have heard that?
It kinda gives away your exact position lol
I read your title totally wrong at first and was wondering why they thought that was odd. Yeah I’ve never heard of anyone putting index on W until this post.
Remove Split and Bind, add back Pearl and Icebox and the map pool is perfect

Yeah this is how he was and he sucked. IMO the shield needs to suck because it’s in a spot rn where it’s either awful or broken as shit.

I think they should revert his shield buff to what it was (what you just suggested) and buff his other abilities to a degree where it’s worth it to play iso for reasons other than the shield
It's not, it makes your heart feel like it's going to explode, and by the time you're done with a session, you're a middle-aged man who hasn't showered in years, sad and alone, and you've eaten the inside of your cheeks and all your teeth are broken. And also you're playing on a cardboard box you drew a screen on with a sharpie, and your keyboard is a dead raccoon behind the grocery store shopping center.
I see, well I'll wait for a couple more days until the new patch, and if it's not fixed then I'll get a refund
If they ignore it because they're afraid of you, it will do enough damage for it to be substantial. It can break Iso's shield, and I've seen people holding angles with a turret and an Outlaw so 140 damage and like 2 turret shots kill the target. So it is useful as something that shoots, and the info it provides is incredibly important

Absolutely based
I kinda agree with dude on this.  Is stw is all you play, and it’s the community you’re a part of and the community you participate in, why would someone go to a different sub to ask a simple question… it doesn’t necessarily pertain to br. And this same thing happened on my stw missions remaining time the other day. It was after reset and it was still showing the previous days missions with a negative mission update timer. Just sayin maybe be a little more considerate before just tellin someone they’re in the wrong place…? Just food for thought yall have a good day!
Welcome to FPS Games and welcome to Valorant. Don't worry about being  a noobie (no hate here). Everyone starts somewhere different.

Maybe some tips to help you get set.

Don't worry about your rank for quite some time. Rather concentrate on being better than yourself from a few games ago or even last game.

To start out you might first want to concentrate these things.

1. How to shoot / hit enemies or in general Crosshair Placement.
2. Go with your team or at least a well performing player.
3. Try to understand what your team needs you to do in any given situation and why.
4. Keep an open mind and maybe watch better players and ask questions :)
5!!! Try to have fun with it. Don't take it too hard. Mute toxic people instantly :)

Have fun, friend :)
I mean me and my friends have been playing since beta we are all ascendant and one of did grind to immortal but overall we play 3-4 games a day for fun and none of really want to try to hit radiant because it’s not worth the grind to get reset after 2 acts none of want to go pro and we aint content creators but giving us a prize that will continue to stay with me even if I fall of will motivate me to get to radiant if only for the skin and then I will have something equipped to show my achievement but without that its not worth the grind for a peak radiant 400 in your tracker and a act triangle that will disappear next act
tracker or blitz
Yes
The whole point of the skins is cosmetics. Skins aren’t made to make you better or worse at the game. It’s a way for the company to make money BECAUSE people like that they are different and “flashy”. Getting distracted by the fact that the skin or the animation is cute is something that goes away eventually. If they can put a $100 price tag on a cute/flashy bundle and are able to sell it then obviously they are going to keep going in that direction
any stat is unreliable if the sample size is too small, if you play more and get closer to your true rank your score should also become closer to reality
Cause you’re taking away one of the alive players on the enemy team instead of someone already dead. Either way it wouldn’t work for the type of game valorant is
I agree, that would be throwing. You reduce your winrate by doing that, but you trick the MMR system into thinking you deserve a much higher rank. So even with a 40% win rate, you will climb. You will be losing 10-15 and gaining 25-30. 

Assuming you are averaging a 2.0 KD which is insane
Most people will say shadowshard - more damage overall at the expense of durability.
 riot’s thought process:

“hopefully there will be one soul out there who doesn’t understand that these skins aren’t unique, poorly made, don’t have finishers, don’t have vfx, or anything cool about them that will buy this bundle because it’s cheaper”
Sed my frnd.
Best: neptune

Worst: hivemind

More in depth,

Overrated: RGX, elderflame,

Underrated: sentinels of light, origin, prelude to chaos used to be underrated
Maybe the OP is shit and insecure. Usually, the ones to call out others are the ones constantly dying. You are matching up with these players for a reason.
I'm sorry, but the plasmatic discharger was in the shop less than a week ago. Why didn't  you buy it then...
- if it gets updated
Counter point: Battle pass exclusivity was lost. The cool part of having old battle pass stuff was that you couldn't get it anymore. 

"Oh, that's a cool gun buddy. How'd you get it?"

"You had to play during Episide 3: Act 2 a while ago."

Now it's "Oh, that's cool, how'd you get that?"
"I bought it. With my Kingdom Credits 😎"

Here is what I do to rank. I have a list of mechanics I need to improve in (ch placement, aim, movement, deadzoning, strafeshooting, bursting, the list is endless).

Then I pick one, watch yt vid on jow to do it right and for the next 5-10 games I only focus on doing it the right way. Not even worried about winning. 

Just proper mechanics
Nice tech. However, I think this would only be good in a double sentinel comp. Whenever I play A, I typically play off an “unbreakable” trip at the entrance to site then a variation or certain trips from gen to the wall / gen to door / stairs to gen
At least you got someone who placed some traps. My 160 missions just have people who build the bare basics and then wonder why nothing dies before reaching objective
There (used to be) a one time exception for every player where you could request to refund a used and or upgraded skin, that’s what I made the post about.
i think either sage or skye, you can still do pretty well for you’re team if you provide health and info. sage you can heal teammates and slow down enemies and skye you can heal and get info. when you don’t want to go into fights just support and with time your aim will get better. from there you can always try out new agents! also mentality is pretty important. recognizing your flaws and where to improve is important as well, but you should also have some confidence. even if you don’t believe it you know what they say, fake it till you make it >:)

Yo laugh when you see a post like this. Bevause you get so upset that it’s east to push you.
Bruh still? It's already down since 4:30
Nope. Getting out of elo hell is impossible, because all ranks are elo hell
this is especially frustrating if u op someone swinging the corner with 150 ping and get onetapped :D
Please dm me
so what's new
Happens
Your electrician should also get an assist for keeping the power in your house on, and while we're at it, your mom should get an assist for giving birth and letting you play the game.

I'm not sure there's a limit with your absurd logic to what counts as an assist if we're going down that line of thinking.
No agent has been more nerfed than Raze leave her alone. Nade is the only thing left untouched since val came out
Crosshair placement, pre aiming, and good reaction time

Pray and play your best so that you can win, else play such that you'll lose less rr
Does anything really need to be done? Have pros complained about her? She simply has unique utility that is high valued in organized play. 

If the meta eventually becomes stale, they should introduce another meta agent or buff existing ones.
I just had a skye who won’t flash an instalock astra that won’t smoke and a bot frag reyna, also my team was 8 ranks below the enemy team, the enemy sova had a full immo triangle. I see this constantly happening that’s why I blame my team but yes am trying to figure out my mistakes as well and improve
On 5 loses streak , stop playing for that day
Araxys, Gaia, Forsaken
This is the way
For your first fps experience Iron 1 is 100% normal.

Thank God my duo is a really good entry, becasue I can't do it. I can do everything else, but don't task me to play duelist.
I really hope these bans aren't coming from a bot, cuz im about to crash out
ITT: Literally every agent
its fun to play valorant.

as for content creators, the valo creators are by far one of the least creative people out there. its always "\[Agent\] to \[rank\] but \[insert condition here\]".

people always say valo doenst have enough for creators, and thats true, but that really doesnt excuse the boring content. i believe theres still much more that can be done. i think thats why creators are burned out, they do what works and dont try new things.
Because it really isn’t lol. Just because posts are made about it doesn’t mean it’s an issue. 7 maps is a lot of maps to have in rotation. Even if all 10 were available at all times, people would still complain about certain maps sucking. Like let’s not act like Pearl and Fracture weren’t constantly being dumped on when they were in rotation.
it seems ur dont own the fouders version of the game this is why u cant earn any vbuks
Meanwhile as an immortal player, I feel bad and borderline pity that you don’t know jack shit. Nothing he said was wrong, you just hate change and love to argue. The lack of content in this game is ridiculous, it’s been nearly half a decade.
It's no more convenient than just using the correct pronouns. The only reason this statement is relevant is because people are so against being accepting that they refuse to change their worldview even the slightest imo.

Who is gonna pay for that Easter eggs and stuff? Valorant isn't a school project, it's a online-service game with millions of dollars involved and getting extra developer for making such things is just not worth it, it's like throwing another 100k/year to make Easter eggs that most ppl don't care about and/or will forget in a few days.
Your content on tiktok is funny 😂
I don't get the hate for fracture can someone explain?
I started bronze, peaked platinum, then it put me in silver after a long break
It’s probably because rito decided to code the kill to happen once an enemy reached that specified distance, and since omen essentially tp’ed, it essentially made him travel an infinite distance (or just a large enough one) which instantly triggered the kill. In addition, there’s a possibility damage could scale on the distance travelled (from 0-150 instantly from point of contact to kill location in a standard ult). So, with that large distance you essentially caused an absurdly huge damage spike or something of the sort, that would give you so much ACS. But yeah it’s still a bug, and im no master at coding, so I wouldn’t know.
wasnt my goal but alr
never ask a valorant player why the clip ends at 4k
I wouldn't say it's bad
Mostly it's people who either won Save the world already or it people who just hate the skin itself.

I bought the pack myself mainly for the v-bucks you get with it.
Also only people who bought founders packs which have been discontinued can get free v-buck.

On a side note you'll have permanent access to STW after buying this pack.

To get the 1500 v-bucks you need to progress through the main story of STW until you unlock daily quests.
You'll then need to complete a total of either 9 or 10 daily quests.

Note that you'll be able to stack up to 3 daily quests at a time and will only get them when you go to the STW lobby.
If you want to get it done quickly only take the elimation quests their pretty straightforward and easy to finish.

I think it too me a week to get all the v-bucks starting from the beginning in the STW campaign.

P.S the Blugo backbling goes hard.
You don't need to add damage, its base damage is already really high
Join the official Val LFG discord and find some good people to queue with. Ones that won’t tolerate shit like this.

PtC is fire, have it on vandal and op, maybe it’s not for you but it’s fire none the less, I like singularity a lot I want that on ares
I’m getting real sick of these surfers making me look bad dammit!
Yes because the other 4 were throwing.
Why does it matter what people charge? It’s a free game. They obviously need to make some part of it expensive in order to make money.

Also, say they charged 1 billion dollars for a skin.

Just… don’t…. Buy it? Who cares.
I would draw if I see my team absolutely no chance of win, like there was this one time the enemy team was full of smurfs, they decided to keep giving us rounds and trash talk us about us not being able beat them. I do agree we can’t, So yes to spite them I drawed the game, if I am going down so are u with me. Don’t play with your food.
Don't get me wrong. I am fine with buying people guns n all that but not every single round when they are non-stop yapper pick mes that try to impress me but do anything to make me dislike them. It was such a petty game...
Git gud.
People who are terrible at stw don't even pay attention to what mission they load into and usually they wouldn't even know what the mission entails based on the title of the mission. They put it on play with others to get the banner or just to farm afk because of the banner achievements, that's more important than playing the game. And ppl who are in 160s or any random hard mission typically want the reward and don't want to waste mats doing it again so they'll put so much effort which is not even necessary because literally nobody knows how to properly build anymore because epic won't remove duplication glitches, and the days of David Dean being the pinnacle of skill are just not even known anymore that's ancient history, so it's not getting any better in pubs
Fade has a lot of overlap with what used to be his niche, and he had a couple nerfs.
We can make a lil pack if I get mine I’ll send you one but you get yours you send me one yknow

I'm gonna throw a cheeky tip in that I haven't mentioned but if you haven't got a headset or even some headphones definitely invest, footsteps don't seem to come clearly with speakers, but the 1st round with headphones in you'll realise you can hear people from miles away sneaking round the back or coming up on your corner etc

Hi, Bronze player here, now i know that my opinion probably will be written off because I'm low elo, but i feel like if you topfrag as duelist but never win it's your team's fault if you entry gain space and take most of the fights and win you do your job to the fullest so i think you should grab a friend or two and play duelist but if you solo queue you might wanna pick someone such as Clove or Breach maybe someone who can be played like a duelist but also helps the team with info and taking space efficiently
No its not. I clearly implied that if there is a way to replicate this whenever you want, its cheating and therefore not a question worth asking, unless there are signs that this cheat is already around.

Doesnt take a genius to understand that.

Crosshair placement and movement... it took me way too long to understand/realize what people meant. :|
The TMNT collab was suppose to come with 2 emotes, a POI location and 4 mythic weapons which is a huge disappointment i'm guessing that it's either fully scrapped or probably saved for a TMNT part 2 collab.  


If they make a part 2 for the TMNT what characters would yall like to see get added for me it would probably have to be shredder, splinter, casey & karai.
Idk if I understand you correctly by normal you mean without any tilt? 

I guess the biggest reason for this is that it’s just more comfortable and healthier for eyes. Like you shouldn’t even consider using monitor without any tilt cuz it’s unhealthy.
He would have a better point if he was talking about veigo and his appearance.
I got myself the Kone Pro Air a while ago since it was on sale for ~60€. Shape isn't ambidextrous but still good. Battery life and weight are good and similar to the superlight (a little heavier but you don't feel the difference that much). Software is a little buggy but once you get it working it's quite nice. Great stock glides. Honestly recommend it if it's on sale. If not, go for the superlight

literally just had 4 people unranked, low level accounts in my game, this is beyond ridiculous, i can't play this game, I'm losing 90% of my game's man
>People keep saying “game doesn't teach you”

...which is honestly such a cop out.

The game didn't teach me, either.  Most online multiplayer games **don't** tell you everything you want or need to know.  But when I first started playing Save the World back in the day, I said to myself:

* "I wonder why there are three different types of building materials, and if there is anything special I should know about their use.  Guess I'll google it."
* "I wonder why there are husks in fire, water, and nature varieties, and if there are any differences besides cosmetic ones.  Guess I'll google it."
* "I wonder why there are all these different storm modifiers, and what they all mean.  Guess I'll google it."
* "I wonder what all these different mini boss modifiers are all about.  Guess I'll google it."

...and so on.  And google it I did, and found all the information that I needed - quickly and easily.  I had questions, and I sought out answers.  That's how you learn stuff in life.

All the people saying "The game doesn't teach you" could also instantly look up any information that they need.  Because we have this thing nowadays called "the internet."  You may have heard of it.

Look up "stw elemental husks" for example, and you instantly get:

* a variety of different [visual aids](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/9gq95b/ultimate_guide_for_elemental_damage_update_here/) clearly explaining elemental damage and building material weaknesses
* half a dozen Reddit posts discussing elemental husks
* a wiki entry about elements in STW
* a bunch of YouTube videos about elemental husks in STW

...most of which would tell you what you need to know about elemental husks, their strengths and weaknesses, and the associated material weaknesses.

It's your responsibility to seek out information that you need and don't possess - not someone else's responsibility to seek you out and give it to you.

The game didn't teach me.  But I educated myself about the game nonetheless.  You can, too.

Went from asc 1 to asc 3 1 game off immo and lost 5 rank ups but always won the 2 next and then went on a 20 game lose streak with 3 wins in those 20 games so 17Ls for 3 W and got down to d3 in 2 days :)
An quick at replying!
No life as well, i see
Yes, but *think* while playing. You can practice a billion things in game as long as you're consciously focusing on them.
Lil bro is most likely older than you might think.
Raze is not comparable to Jett. All of Jetts kit is survivability. 

You can dash away if there are problems, smoke yourself if there's a problem, sometimes updraft to make the enemy harder to shoot you if both abilities are down. This shit cant be done with any other agent.

Raze on the other hand, requires alot more prep in order to be decent compared to Jett.
I use 1600/.15 and feel preety good with it

Yea I honestly don't know what your able to do
>It’s not sexism to be critical or her skill

No, its sexist to not let her on the team solely because she is a woman. I know this kind of nuance is hard to understand on reddit, but youll get there!
We go to the same school, and connected over OG Wuhan Covid lockdown and became close friends. She introduced me to Valorant later, and we’ve never stopped duo-ing or being friends
what rank
every game mode that's not competitive can be for fun
For me it’s Haven at 0%WR, Ascent, and Split both being 33%WR. For me Haven and Split are just too hard to defend and Ascent is hard to attack for me
Weird, are you sure you built it in the right spot? The spawns don't change, and I've used his builds before and they've worked fine.
Yoru, Astra, and Raze
Doing some 160s right now. Vegasx99
lemme guess, you're going to try comparing it to the discharger...

sure, this dam buster has no element but it's probably more focused on knocking smashers around since it has a slightly faster reload time and a bit more impact/knockback than the typical dam buster
Spawns makes highlight videos where he gives his thought process and cypher tech, and I feel like that helped me a lot.
I really really want a Jamaican and a Native American Agent, fingers crossed for next year.
Ranked should come soon afaik

As for the other question, you are supposed and expected to have a mic (at the very least in ranked), however you can still ping the map while you are dead, this is  not supposed to substitute voice comms tho

Played cs 2, server good but merging with cs go dumb choice by valve. Boring to play complicated menu, run and gun, gotta shoot 2 bullets for headshot. Old gameplay sucks. Need new maps that aren't like cs go. Cs 2 disappointing af.

Note: Just my opinion tho, if you into valorant then u prolly agree with me otherwise just have fun playing it or whatever
Thanks for this detailed response! Appreciate it
Plenty of people go up in ELO without getting kills. That end result screen doesnt show off that one molly lineup that won your team the round. or that time your sova hit a godly dart and your raze rocketed 3 people. Or that time your Killjoy's set up fully halted the rotate and they didnt have time to plant. Or that one callout a dead teammate gave that saved your life. These things arent shown, but we all know you dont NEED kills to win the game. The objective is spike blows up or spike doesnt blow up. Players still being alive or not doesn't matter. Solid aim can get you far for sure. Understanding will get you farther assuming you can click their direction a few times, and that might be all you need to win the round.
You know that you can change keybinds in most games, even on console/controller right?
no clue angel, from what I saw on their FAQ, it could be tomorrow or days after it was never specified
yep. gas traps are good in time-out rooms and such were you can trap a few husks under it with tar/freeze traps (or wall CC traps i guess, never see anyone use them). if they stay under for the whole duration then they're the highest damage ceiling trap, but otherwise they're not too good just used out in the open.

i think the real time is like, 2.5ish seconds. IIRC DOT ticks seem to go a little over twice a second, so they don't have to stay under it *too* long.
Fuc Riot with this. They are literally making the game unenjoyable for us players. Valorant was a bit boring in the first place ( don't get me wrong I just mean that Riot is just not adding any fun game mode into the game ) and now they nerfing the whole roster is like a cherry on top for what they were doing. Riot literally never listens to its player base. Might as well remove Viper from the roster than killing her so hard that her pick rate will do a backflip and go back to what it was in Beta. As for cypher, his cam was the only tool that made him OP because he can literally 'Watch' the other side of the map while being in the other side. Riot is flying too up thinking that what they're doing is always right just because their every game has been a success. Someone needs to make Riot fall back to the ground.
I already saw the answer, but I would've guessed Gold.  The jitter and surprise from your Headhunter kill, your movement during your fight with Reyna, planting safe on C when there's no one around rather than out in the open, pulling out util when you're exposed and watching an angle, etc. looks like what I see in Silver and Gold.
Or like, don’t be a dickhead online, it’s super easy to do if you aren’t a manbaby.
My brother gets a lot of the dumbasses bcs he plays on the stw side and I play on the br side...the two things he says happens the most is abnoxious little shits like these and kids that keep on boxing his teddy so it doesn't do anything...and he's been playing stw since the start so his teddy build is highly op he mostly just solos missions without actually doing anything...he lately fully stopped filling up on teams when he goes into missions because he's tired of people just constantly fighting against his teddy
CS has much bigger peakers advantage whereas Val has much bigger holders advantage.  Part of this is due to movement speed, you move faster in CS and have more acceleration/deacceleration time, and that headshots are much easier in Val.  If you peak in CS you're much less likely to get 1-tapped whereas if you peak out in val, you are definitely getting 1 tapped.  This makes ratting better in val.
I got it mixed up with the draw speed between crystal and obsidian and crystal options.
stand still while shooting but whenever there is an opportunity to move into a better position you should
I also got that with a viper but instead of the raze nade it was a headhunter
"Look your enemies in the eyes. It helps with accuracy"

Keep your sens low and aim high. Good luck.
What is the issue with TRO?
Emo vibes finisher
They're a bit unprepared smh

These newies
Harsh truth is there are no real secrets that are going seriously improve you quickly but my experience from going to silver to immo is

1. Working on your crosshair placement (this is the cheat code you don't need to be super mechanically gifted if you have good crosshair placement look at guys like curry, shahzam etc they are just good at crosshair
2. Play a character that you can hard carry on tbh ( silver everyone is not very good and there are a lot of smurfs in this case you need a character you can put the team on your back)
3. unbind crouch (people in silver panick so they croutch because they think it helps it leaves them like sitting ducks so it is easy kills if you don't croutch and panick)
4. DONT TAKE RANKED SO SERIOUS AND LIKE A JOBBBB( have fun you will likely play better and you are playing for fun remember that) 
5. find a good sens that is comfortable for you use them more as a reference for your sens ( you are not a pro copying a pros sens will not better you that much those guys have thousands of hours and they have the best mouse control so copying a sens like 0.55 800 dpi will not help you that much at all)
Ooh
Bruh, if it’s anything like Wildrift, PC will never see this
Fucking cosmetic ult never working when it is supposed to
Low elo is full of bad and toxic people. The only real solution is to rank up.
everything has a counter, including cypher trips
95% probability duped traps. Nobody in their sane mind is wasting quarts and mechanics just to spam tars / AAs everywhere especially looking at that PL range.

Small chance it’s legit and they’re just being silly but almost certainly duped traps. Tar traps don’t even kill they slow/stop husks and smashers.
We might have to kill you for that one chief :/
no

Hmm, you must be lucky then, or someone else in the lobby takes equally as long
Lost it sadly.
This ^ idk why people don't talk about it more often
I actually think the Oni: Vandal, Bucky, shorty, and claw are all great. All that’s missing is variants for the claw. I like Gaia 1.0 a lot. It’s not my style, but 1.0 bundle is great. The 2.0 is not to me outside of the Phantom.
LMFAO best comment
you have 3 years to buy the game..... you missed the boat
It’s patch day
But he already has save the world😂
Here, I am a viper main (well actually play any controller in general) and pretty low Elo as well, for Viper, I guess she is an agent that get's most value if you actually invest more time, like learning lineups and which wall works the best and how to use your ultimate to cover most sight.

In comparison to other controllers, other than Astra she is the most difficult to play with obviously you can get value out of her without those thing as well but if you try to learn her then you will be doing a lot better in one of my favourite agents.
Hey, I'm a teenager going through puberty, and I'm not toxic. We exist.
But it's true, most kids playing this game are edgy, short-tempered and toxic, and I don't know why.
Cant explain your illiterate english
If you have to say I don’t want to be mean, you’re probs being mean
Sorry but the kills don't matter. You just had less impactful kills so you gained less rr.
60hz is okay. Spend more time practice your flick. Aimlab is a good tool.
For agents, play whatever catches your eye, and search for guides on any tech or things to note on your chosen agent.


Crosshairs, you can just search for some online, I think you can also just make your own crosshair, as long as it's not too big, and allows you to aim precisely.


I use a + symbol, coloured red with no outlines. It works best for me, and you can tinker with your own cross hair to find one you like


Tip: go to primary crosshair, turn on "override crosshairs" ( something similar). It changes your shotgun crosshairs to the one you're using, and doesn't give you the shitty circle 
What are the 15-25-35 distances?
I mean she's been meta uninterrupted since release, and I'm beyond tired of the Raze/Jett dichotomy, but I 100% empathize with you about enjoying the satchel mechanic; it's really fun and difficult and rewarding to master. I hope they can balance the agent without ruining the fun.
everyone and anyone who need help, can add soriu. on discord it is with the dot so - soriu.
noone HAS to do anything. You can do whatever you want - as long as you think its gonna win you the game. So if you want think u need a lurk just do it
The map failed to deload and stayed in the background of the quest menu

PC, Windows 11

Switching from the map to quest screen shortly after daily reset

Used to play god of war ghost of sparta on my PSP when I was a kid. After that I didn't do any other sort of gaming. Now I'm addicted to valorant
1000% satcheled into the smoke, never cleared it and didn’t kill you until it faded
I haven’t heard anything about Project T? Is there any source for info on this?
I think it’s a little unbalance where you can be on a half buy and breach can hit a good stun and you can kill 3 right off the start on a tight corner on a map with a cheap gun. Also raze with satchel just breaks the game with it. I think there’s a place for shotguns. I think the Bucky is incredibly balanced. I’d like the see the judge cost more and maybe have a 4 size msg so you can’t spam and kill like 3 people
Pistol rounds and any eco round that the 300 credit difference between it and the sheriff will make a significant impact on my buy the round after

if you think cypher ult is better than any ult not named omen, reyna, or iso, you're just wrong
I don’t think so. Riot is fairly forgiving in that when your restrictions are over, they don’t effect your game at all. They’re just a little “tick mark” on your account.
And like woohoojin says, its more about strategy less about aiming
you need to turn the odds in your favor

also this game heavily punishes you for bad strategy, especially with how you'll become crippled after getting hit
[removed]
Honestly ur playing the most boring agent currently in the game. And ur thinking about doing a complete 180 it seems kinda drastic. Maybe try omen? He got flash and can be played like a doulist but hes still a smoker so ur game time on brim wouldnt be wasted. 


Otherwise man its a game. U should play what is fun for u. But doulist having to entry and the flame u get isnt that fun. If u can handle it and perform well even then thats when it becomes fun.
Maybe in High elo, or non-europe

But I can't hear shit in CS, I think discord is still not discovered by Eastern-Europe CS players because mf having a full conversation after they dead. Can't even understand them because most of the time it's russian/Polish etc.
I thought u were making jokes about actual rotating fan noise
I feel so too
Yeah, I first thought the person was trolling and trying to sabotage my build. He was destroying my base and wanted me to not shoot. I just went and farmed my mats back thinking we would lose. The husks wouldn’t attack the structure and outside of boredom/challenges there is little reason to make more spawn in by killing them. But we shoot anyways 😂
Personally I've never used the wheel, I feel it's more beneficial to just use your microphone.
Bro you’re in bronze
we get it you are a bad lurker, stop trying to defend the fact that they have no impact in the game, and usually only get exit frags
Prime Araxys Chaos
Too real brother
Bro my ghost aim sucks so bad for some reason. I've been playing so many dm's with ghost and range but if I hit a headshot I cannot land another shot
Personally, as a controller main I have experienced numerous shit players who always complained why my smokes are late or why did I not smoke there, but for me it’s also their fault for not holding their ground lol. They can always hide somewhere or pick an angle where it’s not noticeable. Lmao
na codes requested
Pretty damn small if I wanted to use my mouspad with that sense I'd have to physically pick up my mouse and put it back on the mouse pad because it would just go off the mouse pad with a 180
Literally Split lmfao

[https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Split?so=search&file=Split\_minimap.png](https://valorant.fandom.com/wiki/Split?so=search&file=Split_minimap.png)
This map took 7 years to release...it was "ready" before Twine was imagined.

Now, imagine releasing the map unfinished and untested...ta daaaaaa today.

Obviously, the Space Heroes would be perfect for this new biome, but BR & Creative got in the way.

Azalea Clark is a joke of a hero, kinda resembles Epic's effort on this one.

Harness your energy to press them for fixes.
For a newer msk player, a blast from the past lynx loadout with buff support for launcher and melee would be my recommendation.  You are more tanky so you don't get downed too easily
Honestly i prefer the light sounding ones, i feel like it makes me hit more one taps
![gif](giphy|Jj9IEqJOkbeww)
not gonna sugarcoat it, you have a massive mindset problem but you are aware of it which is great. idk how to fix it because i dont know you but:

after every game, regardless of outcome, take a walk around the house and drink some water to mentally reset

set up a routine at the beginning of every round to mentally reset yourself
- say either "good shit, team" or "NT NT" or "my bad" depending on win or lose
- close your eyes and take one deep breath
- check your teams money/ults
- check enemy money/ults
- think of one thing you or your team can do and comm it (or more if you want to igl)
ofc you dont have to do exactly this but this is a good starting point, it gets you to stop focusing on past rounds and instead think of the current/future rounds

making a spreadsheet might be helpful. start thinking of your games as nothing more than data points. make a log of your games, and make sure to include one thing you did well, one thing that went poorly, how you could fix that issue, and the generalized concept that you can apply to future scenarios eg 
- my flash timings were great
- but on defense my team on the other site kept getting blitzed
- i should have Oped/played centrally and rotated faster/pushed for info/set up a team play/trade fragged better/whatever else
- when my team is shit and cant hold a site, i need to get very proactive for info or kills or switch it up in some way

or

- my gunfights were very calm and i got some great kills
- but on attack, we had no idea how to take mid on ascent 
- i should watch pro players ranked streams to see how they do it
- if i dont know how to do something, i should watch pros and take notes

if you go into the game with the mindset of learning one thing, the outcome will matter less because win or lose, you became a marginally better player. if you are able to, recording and watching your games will help massively with this.
Basically electronic stuff like cars, power boxes, etc. also search things like crates. Can also do expeditions for traps and recycle them. They aren’t hard to find but usually drop in low quantities compared to other major crafting items and energy cell weapons usually drain them really fast

Ok but then when they add old maps back in, new players have no experience on them and old players know them like the back of their hand so the new people are going to just get smoked every time. They need to have them all in unrated at least.
There's a lot of things people don't do in bronze/silver
I know you probably don't but do you have an extra code
You can be shot while in the ghost form as seen in the clip, presumably you can shoot your gun again afterwards as there's no reason to self rez just to reposition. 

There is an also timer (indicated by a popup on screen) for how long after death you have to activate the self rez, it seemed to be about 2-3 seconds before running out.
0.42 at 800 dpi
There was an old animation??
Depending on the map, shorty satchels.
If being born with a hand and a functioning brain that you can train into doing the same action countless times until it does it more accurately then yes
It’s not to top or bottom frag. Even in e-sports teams they have a bottom frag but they do win.
It is the utility and being “unexpected”. Be more patient on taking hits. Do not commit to every fight, you can control some routes the enemy takes with ur utility. Camp sites in defense, if the spike is dropped, camp the spike. Learn post plant Strats.

Think ahead. Of tour team is in sight and u do not have the spike, watch out for flanks.

In valorant, if you move better u’ll die less

I can’t speak for lower ranks but if I don’t play at the start of a reset I’ll still be playing against the same former Immortal/Radiant players when I come back because we are in the same MMR range, there typically isn’t much point in waiting IMO.
Nah the enemy team was clueless, nice clutch though
Ok then where it has been proven ? If i go on twitch and check everyone that does msk almost all the them use the potshot or wrath the few only that does use plasmatic dies few secs after and loose the fight, the people that goes in public msk wants their weapons not losing the fight constantly
I honestly dont know much about the valo lore tbh , i just got really interested in cloves character.
What region do you play in? Your account is very new for the rank you're in so if you are not smurfing then you're doing fine. You just need to play more games.
I tried to message PlayStation support but they said to go message epic about it. But at that point I just refunded my money from ebay bc it’s against policy to buy codes like that
The barrier mesh's length can be adjusted with a max cap. You can edit which 4 sides are present and you can also remove the barrier mesh fully by recalling it.

The sonic sensor does not stun allies and yourself.

She gets two gravnets. I think the ability itself is already good.

Annihilation has a longer range and an increased radius of the tip sphere as well as the path cylinder.

Would be fun :)
Half of the clip you are staring at the ground seems pretty bronzy to me
i hate all of you, no exceptions and goodbye
Definitely don’t look like a noob but idc either way 😂

Aim is mad crazy even for someone who plays a lot. Good shit

I wouldn't sigh. Its a coop game. Best case scenario tbh
She had a 0% percent pick rate on breeze last time breeze was played in pro play. Feel free to look up the matches and see why you can get maximum more value with viper or even cypher. Long rotations make your wall useless. It takes 5 seconds to break wall and entry with a coordinated team. Viper can semi easily solo defend a site certain rounds and cut off a lot of mid, you’re not doing that with sage. Unless you’re talking from a low elo perspective which in case it doesn’t matter what you pick
This is the way
i dont even get players
“MMMMMM”
Scheduled leaks*
If only they didn’t ruin the purple version of vct. I spent like a year straight running every variant but the purple one.
Oh yeah I actually forgot about that lmao. Double nade 10s boombot 6 point ult that killed anything within a mile radius. Good times
OP clearly is, not sure the others are
I think Tenz has the Moondrop Blessings 2. I actually have a pair myself but they’re like 300-400? They’re very nice headphones, as I use them outside of gaming, but you can get something similar for gaming for cheaper.

I don’t know off the top of my head, but I think they’re the Moondrop Arias? When I did my research they were like less than $100.
Fortnite inflation
Yeah, that’s why you need to call it out as it happens and not give him time to make shit up, it’s awkward as hell, I know, but not saying anything or listening to his bs will only make him more delusional
i never have to respond bc I always have enemy text muted.

unbind crouch
reach diamond first before wondering if you can reach further
This doesn't apply to the guardian or headhunter and I'd even say the bulldog.
can u give a  link
If you deserve rank you'd have it.
Unlucky and also maybe you made movement before you made the shot so that made it inaccurate too.
They're region locked, just mind you.
Had a kind impolitely nag me literally every buy round. Even when he couldn’t buy he’d sometimes ask me and I’d call the fool out. I just pretend to b afk at the start of the round sometimes to enjoy their defeat slowly getting realized in their tiny heads. Just buy in the last 10 secs and walk on site (I never play pre round setup agents anyway so not too much of a deal to do once or twice a game)
My PC took long breaths just to see this edit
Yup , I'm aware. I noticed with my bloodshot eyes 🤣🤣☠️ 

But yeah. I've been playing for 11 months now and I just love this game so much. Glad to hear your words
The map I hate the most is Bind because there is no mid so it's limiting where you enter or rotate and it pisses me off. I generally love having lots of options in any type of games
I will say, age is just a number. My grandma used to play Mario and Contra with me at the age of 78. :p
We know riot, it will most likely not
Punishment
You should use the right subreddit, this one is for save the world
Know this feeling
The best harbor iv3 every seen was in ice box and especially on A site his bullet proof circle allows him to plant especially when the enemy team are coming from all directions.
Personal I’d do founders drumroll because you can’t get them anymore so demand is huge
you're not in elo hell. you're just shit at the game
Okay then why would Jett be better Smurf than iso? 😂
I'd say brim-sensei's up there as well
Maybe there’s no new content because epic is a corporation that is out to make money and they don’t want to waste resources on a game that people don’t play.
- Purchase Fortnite. Easy Exp, missions are like 20k for ten minutes work. Dailies are 15K, weeklies 71K. I only really play BR when a friend wants to or to check the store since VBucks are free and useless for older players. It’s nice to jump onto BR and see that I’ve somehow gained 10 levels just messing around playing campaign. 



- As for BR, wins are easy enough, the game’s never been that hard. Just survive and clap a couple people per match. Exp seems pretty fair, especially with Milestones (5K each) and Survivor Medals (10K each). Also the BR Season lasts until March, there’s gonna be nothing new to do after everything else in the Pass releases in a few weeks. If you didn’t buy Fortnite and only play the free spin-offs just take your time with it, no rush

It's only good for advanced players, they are more limited than controllers like others pointed out
I guess for abilities are rewind, the ice power from mha update and a ground smash I guess 🤷🏾 plus save the world subreddit 🤔
i'm doing so, already deleted the game and went to play some R6, heard they are buffing characters and changing the game to be fun instead of just catering for pro play.
It realistically shouldn’t cost more than 6500 but knowing riot it’ll probably be insane for some reason
thats fair.
average CS player buying AK on 2nd round running off alone only to die lose the weapon and now a CT is outgunning your smg's lul
Off angles were a dream because of the 2 up drafts and insta dash.
This single post here made me question why I still have a Reddit account to this day
I played the shitty Counter Strike port on the Xbox 360 years ago. If it's anything like it, it will be dogshit. Here's hoping it's not but it did not feel good to play lol
predictable,very loud and usually can be stopped by one piece of utility (smoke,molly,tripwire). instead you should quietly walk up,and after you got close to site use all of utility at the same time to surprise enemy. split is also good because enemy will have to watch two places at the same time,so try them both and see what works best
"Hows everyone doing today/tonight?"
Typically, i get greeted 1 of 2 ways.
"Oh its good/alright/pretty bad, *insert last few games here*"
Or,
"Shut up."
You’re playing a 4 vs. 5 every game with a duo you’re boosting. Either help them improve or only play unrated with them. You could optionally have another account that you solo queue on so their feelings don’t get hurt if it’s your SO.
expect to play with braindead people if you play ranked, but if you play swiftplay/spike rush people are pretty fun and talkative
That isn't the actual woohoojin, btw.
There is matchmaking it's just way more leanient than in comp to reduce queue times. You won't get matched against radiants or anything but I was once unlucky enough to land in a dia/ascendant lobby in unrated as high gold, that wasn't really distinguishable from aimbot for me.
There's definitely something going on. Nowadays I lose my comms majority of my matches
i mean it still happened in csgo so you can still just call it csgo’ed
What do you expect when 90% of omen content creation is someone smurfing and using their blind to teleport behind people and knife them, instead of showcasing it's ability for team play. There are so many cool spots you can throw your blind from to clear angles for an aggressive duelist. One of my favourite combo's is throwing it from sewers on Split for a Raze or Jett to fast take ramp and heaven.
Gotta hit those flung husks somehow.
oh no, seems like u lost 12 rr, very harsh...

that is so little. 12 rr a year or more averages to 1 rr a month lost to u being afk (whether its ur intention or not) i dont get the problem here.
If you never played valorant but have 100k gridshot on aimlab - Bronze to Silver
If you know basic of valorant with the above aim - Gold 
If you know variables that support aim e.g. tapping, movement, swinging - You can reach low ascendant
By the time your there, your gamesense has already developed to some degree, and play more, then you will reach immortal.
If your new to the game but have good aim vs no fps experience, its like a head start to a marathon, but all depends what you do during the race.
Have you re rolled another quest in the last 24 hours?
In the title you say 3 VP but in reality its 63 VP lmao
the players of course, put a good player on a mid agent and they will make it work

im trying to say that these agents are pretty hard to contribute to the general success of the team (in lower ranks especially) as with Reyna or Jett players just tend to bait and use their util pretty selfishly (like any other duelist, but Reyna and Jett player are most common) and Sages usually just play for heals, reses and dont get much value out of their walls and slows
Exactly it would make the game more fun and make sure you are perfectly warmed up before each match.
lol Val is my very first fps game on pc and I cheesed my way to diamond within 2 months by watching Perry and learning every lineup and only using judge and op. My friends were stunned
I don't rate it that high for the looks but my glitchpop phantom is something else. I've clicked heads mid air with it, so that's the best phantom for me, even though I don't use it that much.

In terms of looks, I like neo frontier, oni, protocol, magepunk and rgx, in that order.
[removed]
That would be quite a lot of cypher trip wires and deadlock walls.
tldr
> Most people use swift play to warm up/play as new players prior to playing ranked

Most? Says who? The data shows that fewer and fewer are playing ranked. 

A big chunk of players just play swiftplay because you don't need to commit to 60mins games, they're just playing valorant for fun
Me when kids post on the wrong sub
Why suggest doing shit talking? That makes you just as bad as the others that do it.
did they leak a new map somewhere? I thought we would not get one this entire episode
But I want the umbrella though
I definitely agree it's the best fix to Viper but that's because it makes it very easy to intuitively add the change she absolutely needs which is "ending the wall early wastes the rest of the tank"


That way she can put the wall up, say, only 4 times per round total, but still have a max ranked uptime of 4x her old 15s uptime.


Harbor I don't think needs quite as drastic a change because his issues stem more from how his abilities deploy compared to other controllers rather than the amount he gets.
Cypher main here

Playing as :

- On attack, always place a trap behind your team or behind you If you're lurking. Place it at eyes level when crouching, so it can't be passed over by jumping or crouching, and be aware of enventuals box that could help get around your trap.

- On defense, don't go always on the same site, learn how to predict on wich site the ennemies are going (it will come with experience) and also, don't do the same setups. If you see that a trap isn't efficient against your opponents, change it. 

- Be creative with your traps, don't always do the most obivous ones or they will get destroyed

Playing against :

-If you're near a trip, check if you could jump over it or crouch below it, most cypher just play by there trips

-If you're pushing site and see that Cypher's setup is on this site, rotate. Most of the time when i am defencing with my setup on the right site, my team win the round because of the combo traps + smokes that nearly guarantee you free kills 

- If the Cypher is on attack, be aware when you're rotating, we like to lurk.
I wouldnt say highest but its definitely up there


still baffles me how hes the only character in the game that has universal trips, i feel like riot would’ve added more characters with kits like that but i guess not
Sadly it won't 😁
Yes and no. U can't choose styles. This back bling will gain only color of the highest rank you get in season. And that is shitty(
can't believe I'm getting GENG v SEN and LOUD v PRX for my birthday 😍😍
You are already an Immortal player so hitting Ascendant without comms shouldn't be a fair representation that comms aren't as important because you already have the skill level of an Immortal player. So of course you're going to be shooting up the ranks faster than your main account because you are essentially just skill checking lower elo players.

  
However, while I disagree that you say comms aren't as important, I do notice that when playing in a lower elo that usually tuning out teammate comms often is beneficial as their comms aren't always the best.
Buy an SSD
Find a duo at a similar rank that’s also trying to rank up! Playing together makes it much easier. Especially since you can have at least one person you can coordinate with.
Bronze sucks. You are either up against a smurf or your team mates don’t know offense vs defense. I have a few bits of advice to get you out of bronze.
1. Instalock somebody your comfortable with and play like its a 1v5. Counting on most team mates in that low of elo gets you killed more times than not. 
2. Practice and play with the focus of getting better. You should be able to carry the momentum of your games to get you out of bronze. Util is much less important so start doing aim labs and literally just out aim everyone. Make sure you are clearing every corner and angle with good crosshair placement
3. IGL. I’ve had success making all the calls and plays for my team so we use util together and swing together and the enemies in that elo don’t know how to counter it. I swear I had more teammates with come in bronze than I do right now in Asc.
4. Don’t be toxic. You can so quickly kill your team’s mental by being toxic to team mates. Some people take it really personally when you call out a bad play. Just be nice and considerate about how you make calls.
5. Don’t ego peek everything. The biggest problem I see in EVERY ELO is my teammates on defense getting 1, then pushing and getting traded instead of backing off. It completely defeated the purpose of getting your one. It’s so important to be patient and play numbers with your team. My friends and I always 5 stack comp for fun (one of them who is iron) and we tell him to take no fights and just play his life. The idea of him being alive to the enemy team is more valuable than the 80 damage he might have done before he died.

If you don’t have the time or care that much to rank up there is nothing wrong with that. My friends and I mostly just 5 stack comp together because everybody just ffs in unrated and its fun to try hard sometimes
Still no change in that vc glitch where our mics would go off on their own mid match and would only start again in the lobby once the match is over
Just Smurf, it doesn't really matter. If you are five stacking they will probably have smurfs anyway
omen
well, it is definitely better than the dream of the other part of sub in form of "all enemies are basic husks who will die from xenon bow spam in less than 2 seconds after spawning"
Cracked run and gun play keep it up
It is actually a second round but if you win 😁
u/lllllleaf (op), this goes for you too
I'd just become a dennis too
[removed]
to be totally honest, when is he really making fun of them? Yes, he‘s smurfing, yes, he knifes alot but personally I‘ve never seen him disrespectful to lower elo players. 

I‘d even say when it comes to coaching, he‘s one of the few who doesn’t judge motivates them imo
The whole reason of a video game is to have fun. If not using voice is fun for you then don’t use.
Someone explain wat do when 1v1 deadlock ult
[removed]
I got an email from Riot that I was invited
I think this is like tlou 2 where they move it to the side so the barrel of the barrel of the gun  won’t get in the way of the scope.

“Reactive”? That’s a weird place for this word
The hate against Americans is pretty real . Does it  count as racism.

In Asia, skin tones dislike each other, different countries look down or despise each other. Even in the Indias with same race/skin colour, you get hate.

But laughing at US is cool and pretty alright cos everybody's doing it, amirite?
smaller range and more expensive
Yeah, ranked is in a horrid spot if you care about progression
Just go into deathmatches with a different mentality. Its you against an entire lobby with things that will simply be out of your control. Deathmatches should be warmups or a place to try out weapons you don't usually use. Been having a ton of fun trying out the stinger to figure out how to use it more effectively
I think you kinda missed my point. Fracture is solely built around this one gimmick of 2 attacker sides. I don't hate this idea, but... I'd rather like more indepth maps, than maps which fully rely on a gimmick. In my opinion Map Design > Gimmick.
Not an ego, but everyone is letting you know this is a clown take and you're still insisting that it's not. Lower ranks have a misunderstanding of what makes a character powerful/how to use and react to utility. If you're having problems with Raze utility, consider that maybe it's a case of needing to learn how to play around her. Raze is not strong enough to need her kit reworked
Are people really saying Brim it's like the opposite of the character.

Perhaps it's cause post plants but Viper does the same thing but her core gameplay leans into lurking and blocking people from going places.

Feel like Cypher, KJ and Astra all fit the more passive role.
Damn, that's unlucky. I just played 3, was fine. Played like 9 hours yesterday. Only a couple games I think where people left. Hope it gets better for you.
How has it been broken? I play dm daily and I really don't see anything wrong with it. The thing happening in this post is obv a bug bcs of the map change.

Interesting changes but it makes Breeze way less open which I fell was what made it special in the first place, felt like no place was safe and you could get 5v1'd from anywhere lol
You're in the Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that isn't on mobile, even on GeForce, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR
I saw it once then someone upgraded the wall and RUINED IT!
The point is that just being slightly short of the entire duration is enough to tank it.
Everyone uses pronouns lmao where have you been?
only saw minimal run and gun  
some with just hit with rng  
most i saw that's really close range that it will hit more anyway
Ωραίος ο τυπάς.
Yes there are aimbot cheats. 

Thankfully I’ve only played against that one single cheater and he was banned pretty soon after. My friends who have been playing longer haven’t ran into too many, but yes they exist - although typically they’re not as blatant as that. 

From my current understanding, cheats are very expensive in Valorant so most probably don’t want to get caught.
Just hide the level. Simple and try to enjoy. Play support complement your team and dont be too hard on yourself. - A fellow bronze hardstuck
But late but adding to this Maver1ck has some amazing flash and flash tp guides. Something he calls a minus tempo flash is always good for 1 minimum.
He is at the cementary
I agree with this a lot. I personally never played ranked much until recently (currently iron 3) I always feared ranked bc of the toxic players, so i stuck to swift. I have started a warm-up routine, as well as played overwatch 2 for practice 😅. But no matter how well I do, we could lose to trolls or players who are afk but have something on their keyboard to not get kicked. It's really annoying and I hope we can solve this. I personally recommend using the"LF Valorant" server (which u can find on the official Valorant server) where the players are pretty nice and mostly want to rank up! If you take anything out of this, don't solo queue! Best of luck ranking up

It's just your shitty internet mate, also wrong sub
They were in the bath for too long
This is a clip from literally yesterday lol, this one is a fun one to do  
https://outplayed.tv/media/bXleRY
Well that’s cause brain dead low elo players wall mid right away when it gets broken down in 5 seconds at the start of the round. They don’t adapt to the fact that someone is just there sitting and watching the dumbass sage autopilot and wall as soon as the round starts. But when the players are better they will actually wall at the right times and not just randomly throw up a wall immediately when there’s 5 ppl waiting to shoot it down because they know the sage will do it.

That's what I was trying since I Started playing.. and to make sure that happen I focused in playing unranked so I don't get distracted by my rank.. but even though I played 814 Matches in unranked I still find iron hard 🤦
Kj turret used to still work after you died. Won a 3v0 cause of that
This reset was much more severe. The amount of Immortal players is .5% of the player population this episode. Last episode during act 2 around the same time Immortal was top 1% of players. They literally cut the Immortal player base in half this episode and the same stats can be seen an ascendant. Riot really pushed alot of people down to make higher ranks more exclusive.
I don’t think so, but do think they’ll perform any better if they can’t play the only character they know how to play?
iron is honestly full of smurfs, trolls, players who dc, and mfs who cant play.

i was silver 2 last act and it took me up until about a week ago to get out of iron
Yeah each agent require different skill set but there's no way you reach immortal with silver game sense as you said before
Still looking for a ps code!
Spray those smokes baby. When you see the enemy isn't respecting your smokes and just pushes through them. It's time to get a well timed spray on their entry and try to take 2 of them.
I am a high ego player I would always prioritize the ace
Because if you were actually top fragging almost every match you would rank up, the hidden MMR system would recognize this, if you believe you are are actually top fragging almost every match drop a tracker so people can see. 

Every system has issues and the hidden MMR system is not without faults but there is no way an iron top frags almost every match and stays in iron unless they hardly play any games. and if that is the case then you don't need to do anything but play more games and you will rank up.
How do I get good at counter strafing and peaking in and out of cover while shooting :) bronze 2 btw
Search then smash
I  agree with icebox, but on split? No serious team ever runs sage over cypher on that map.
What’s with all the bootlickers? It’s a beta, not an alpha, it should be working and the original beta for PC never went down like this without communication. 

There’s also multiple games that are under “beta” or early preview” that don’t have these issues and are not a multimillion dollar company.
Sabine is that you
[removed]
Yeah like everyone else has said you've barely scratched the surface of the game in terms of playtime. Just play, have fun, keep a good mindset and the fundamentals you're practicing because it'll come.
Bro did and got called out as well
It's a specific predatory way to make you spend money RIGHT NOW. Because of the rotating shop and limited availability of items
Psychology major here, that seems like something that can be worked through with some mindset changes, don't beat yourself up over it too much! I sent you a dm where I offered help so let me know if you'd like that :)
Asc is the top end of medium elo

Most people dont comm and its 50/50 if your teammates care about agent composition, and its mostly a tdm with simple ability usage and strats
I’m only diamond 1 but I turn down volume to like 20% (or 0%) and just try to move and peek angles with intention. (trying not to expose to too many threats with a peek, not zooming around corners without clearing likely danger zones). Just generally trying to practice good fundamental peeks and clean gunfights.

I either keep moving in one general direction or, based on intuition, sometimes I u-turn and start moving back through the areas I just came through to avoid getting shot in the back lol. 

But you just gotta shrug off getting shot from behind. For me having lower volume (or muted) helps me focus on my technique and not focus too much on footsteps and the sound of me getting thwacked in the back of the head out of nowhere.
Console looking interesting, didn’t even know it released already tbh.. why does the ads, ads?
Yeah, but its not that much money compared to this new chapter, which has: a whole battle royale map + the event + an entire battle pass and tons of skins + a few new mechanics + revamped movement + a few new guns + 3 gamemodes that couldve been their own games
It's called trading, not baiting. That's how you win games. Swing in pairs and win engagements
ok
I'm currently A2 and this guy is correct. You won't get out of gold with your current mindset. You also have double my hours. It's not about ego, truth hurts homie
As they should this is ridiculous
It literally call unrank so everyone can play together.
Sova, since Closed Beta
by winning games. hope this helps.
I recommend  trying out Swift Play. Games are short so if you have toxic teammates you can always remember that the game will be over soon. It's also great for trying out new agents & practicing normal gunplay unlike DM. Lastly the chance of having rude teammates is significantly lower since the games don't matter much
• Region: NA  
  
• Type of Bug: Technical/InGame?  
  
• Description: Game keeps getting AltTabbed out it seems only during Overtime in ranked. Happened yesterday where it kept getting worse as rounds went on. To the point where getting back into the game I could hear me firing non stop on its own to notice all my ammo was gone. Eventually couldn't get back into game and couldn't click anything on PC or close out of anything. Had to hard reset PC. Just happened again earlier. Everything else on my PC has worked perfectly as always.  
  
• Video / Screenshot: None  
  
• Steps to Reproduce: Kind of  hard to reproduce result as its only during Overtime. I don't know the steps. The only thing that was the same this time as last time when it happened yesterday is I had a chrome tab on YouTube in the back minimized, Open Hardware Monitor and Discord opened which it always is. Seems to only happen when I get into Overtime in ranked games  
  
• Expected Result:  
  
• Observed Result:  
  
• Reproduction Rate: Only happened twice. Both times were when I got into Overtime in Ranked. No other time. So technically its happened 100% of the time.  
  
• System Specs: AMD Ryzen 9 5950x, Windows 10, Gigabyte Nvidia Geforce RTX 4070 Aero OC, 32 GB RAM
You're the 5th. Sorry, but you need to have a positive impact on your team if you want to rank up.
Valorant was the first ever game I’d played so when I was learning I didn’t know what CT meant, I just learned where those places were when people would call it out. It wasn’t until I found a very nice team when I was finally high silver that I felt comfortable to ask and found out what it stood for

It’s not a mindset it’s the actual facts and nobody said it’s impossible just shouldn’t have to keep doing it. You guys like to argue ?
I'd rather the STW packs were disconnected. I'd love all the characters, but have no need for 5 unusable, ungiftable, unsellable, untradeinforvbucksable copies of STW. Just normal outfits at okay prices. 

Or a permanent outfit store where STE players can buy BR skins of STW characters you earned (that aren't past BP locked). That would help everybody out.
Wtf you talking about. The point proves that if a female is good enough to hang with the boys she can. And it has everything to do with skill.
"you shouldn't get angry when playing videogames" isn't really valid, for some people, games that aren't competitive are uninteresting, and the only satisfaction you can get is from the highs and the lows, myself included with some exceptions

Similar thing is happening in FlexQ as the matter of fact. [This is one example of it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/140r53d/high_elo_flex_queue_is_a_joke/)
no but you guys barely have any life outside of video games if thats the only way you seek attention. sure i play video games with my friends but sometimes we like a competitive environment like in sports but theres you attention seekers who try their hardest to get a reaction out of someone in video games because no really cares about you in real life

Lately I’ve been getting hit with Cloves that have the same level of foulness. It makes no sense that some the most “phobic” people are playing Clove, right? They’re literally a nonbinary agent, so why are half of the Clove mains homophobic???

Yes that healing was a bit much for lower ranked and smurfs on Reyna.


I think it was a good decision, but still what do i know anyways.
Alright makes sense. So would I just follow the normal routine but on easy instead of medium?

Try learning the lineups for Viper on Breeze since that's her best map. Use Omen/Brim for all the other maps.

See how much impact having a few line ups for post plant is and see if it's worth it to learn more. You can definitely win rounds that are unwinnable just because you double molly to stall for time.

Launch pads were leaked awhile back, still no update on them though.
you're right, but it gets a little worse than that: each survivor perk bonus does increase the respective FORT stat; but *only* for the thing it actually says it does. you don't even ever get to increase your overall power by 1%, you have to choose one very specific thing to specialize into. 

having more offense would be nice, but no; you *have* to choose either ranged or melee damage. you don't get to boost both shield and shield regen rate, one will always be handicapped without the other. and tech is a super important stat because it effects so many things, but "ability damage" literally only affects abilities, not the powerful "Hero Ability Damage" stat like normal tech does.

Likewise I feel like you're drawing out something that a beginner will have little ability to improve on without first learning about movement and positioning. They won't get much of a chance to practice aim if they've been domed already because they were a sitting duck. The first thing you get taught in the military is safety and positioning. Aim and marksmanship discipline are very importantly second to this
wth
1: only the vbucks you buy with any pack, you have to be a founder which you cannot purchase unless you can track down a valid code somewhere

2: it's enjoyable yes

3: plenty, last time i looked there were 29,000 people playing at that given time, i don't think i've ever seen it under 20k

4: It never was

5: yes, just be aware that the official discord takes zero effort to get banned for no reason at all other than existing, so don't be surprised when it happens out of the blue.

6: DO NOT INVEST your resources into evolving weapon and traps or even heroes rapidly, and try to limit yourself to only a few specific ones if you're going to evolve anything at all. You NEED to invest those evolutionary materials and experience gained into survivors that you place in survivor squads. Your overall powerlvl dictates your ability to progress and deal damage and play effectively. A player with a pwlvl of 100 paired with a hero that is only pwlvl 77 hero and weapon for example, will massively out damage a pwlvl 50 player with a pwlvl 144 hero and 144 weapon. A player's pwlvl will cause the tools they use to be deleved to their level making it completely silly to go much beyond your own level, it's a waste. The only advantage for traps and schematics to be higher, and only 3rd evolution at that, is to unlock the perks that come with it. So in all honesty, if you can find ideal weapons, Xeon bow being one of the all time universally powerful for any case, getting it rolled over as a 3 star will make it effective even for a pwlvl 1 player, but there is no advantage of leveling it up to pwlvl 77 until you're at pwlvl 77.

Personally, my biggest beef with the game is with tagging and aim punch.

For one, I'd make tagging more gradual. I think you get punished way too hard to just receiving one or two body shots while peeking, it can completely fuck you up if you were trying to strafe your crosshair on to an angle. Rewarding a player for body shots is fine but it shouldn't totally penalise the other player for taking the time to move into the right angle.

The other change I'd make is to have aim punch significantly reduced if you are headshot while at 50 armor. I think the current design is to give eco weapons a chance, but they are already plenty strong in this game, and getting aim punched by one just makes a fight totally impossible for a rifle. This would be fine if we had mostly long-range angles which inherently benefit rifles, but the reality is that VALORANT maps are like >50% close-range angles.

> What I would do

I like a bunch of your suggestions, but not gonna lie, the entire gunplay section just reads like "I prefer CS, make the game more like CS".
2 things: toxic pieces of garbage


And breach mains
Pearl is/was. The only map where I remember spamming being an actual issue. If you have good B plant you can just retreat and spam. Idk why they're implementing this change at the same time as the pearl changes.
yeah...about that NRG pick.
From listening others complain its like a percentige that goes up a bit but its not like 9/10 games everyone comms in elo x. Complains about comms come from all elos.
Hate the shorty, but the operator is my beloved
Yes peeking three people is a good play that you can certainly do anywhere at any time with other agents

Went to this post to find out a definitive answer. I see three votes for a post with "bucky always head" and three votes for body only...
I’m not defending a dc in unrated. I’m saying that your hella capping that “basically everyone u know uses unranked to warm up for ranked”. Different people do different things but warmup in unranked is objectively worse.
With double rankups starting at 0 rr if you won the maximum every game 6
Everyone’s just boosted always someone clearly not at the right rank playing 4v5 in immo is annoying as fk
Not a clove main but whenever I use her a good strat is to throw meddle through smokes and spam . You can do it with a phantom for no bullet tracers or an Odin for the most kills; one game I got 2 3ks by just odin spamming after meddle lmao.
Is there a specific reason you invested in skins on your alt account?
above average for sure but not to the point where she is a prodigy. that being said if she keeps playing could be very very good

diamond because of the teamwork with the flash
I genuinely think omen would be a good fit as the only smoke with a semi agro kit (except clove if u count ult) with his flash and tp its easy to have fun but also not feel too daunting like astra
Nah bring back perma flash. Want to bully my enemy
I started at iron 2 or 3 i believe. Never touched csgo so i came in here blind. Then i reached gold 3 by the end of the beta. Climbed to plat and was scared of playing comp but then i developed this mentality of just continuing and pushing and have this idc mentality. So rose to plat then diamond then ascendant 2 or 3 i  believe. I dont play as much but rn im stuck at plat(currently plat 3)

Hmmmmmmmmmm. KAY/O?

My argument had 2 points:

1. There is no way they deliberately made a worse product out of consistency (your argument).
2. If they had the ressources to make a better product they would have done so.

Now what the hell are you trying to argue about, since non of what you just said defended your own argument which I called bullshit.

If you just want to argue for the sake of it, making non arguments, I really don't intend to waste my time.

I've seen several articles claiming to have encountered cheaters, but none of them have recorded videos or provided usernames or tracker. 

By the way, I definitely believe there are cheaters in this game. 

But not forget that this game's high-end players only about 1% (Immortal 1+).

I absolutely cannot fucking stand haven at all. The very sight of it makes me want to dodge it immediately
I think we would need some more agents before it could get implemented well. There was a tourney called “Freezeout” that had similar rules and it resulted in some super interesting games. Check that out if it sounds cool to you
I think its level 310 to max all of the upgrades anyway, not sure why people use these
Yeah valorant contrary to overwatch has big focus on actual low time-to-kill gunfights, less than CS but more than another other fps.

An immo+ can play in Asc+ without any ability and hold his own, I guess in lower elo it's even easier, silvers might actually be silvers even without abilities given how they \[mis\]use them.
It has been used already. Tx anyway.

No shit. Your rank is a function of all the different aspects of your skill. You’re nerfing one part of it and you’ll be placed in the appropriate rank of someone with your game sense who only uses sheriff.

try move ur mouse in tiny lil ways instead of big sweeping motions. muscle memory is key here, just gotta keep practicing even if it feels like u aint gettin nowhere. also maybe try playing some aim training games or watching tutorials on how to improve your microadjustments. gl hf!

Standing in a Harbor smoke/wall with Neon or KAY/O instantly kills you.

Killing Raze causes her grenades to cook off, causing a huge explosion.

KJ's turrets had their software updated and can now aim for the head.
I don't really see how these changes are supposed to help Reyna in a team environment at all so not sure why they made it sound like that.

*BASS BOOSTED SONAR DART PING*
Send me one Ill tell you why its a scam rn.
Detrimental long term like if you want to go pro.

But for anyone trying to hit mid-upper normal people ranks its bar none the best way to get up. Maybe in immortal people struggle to hit radiant because of it
Some things I see that diamonds do a lot is when in agent select if they see 2 duelist auto lock they get mad and all select duelist where as in high asc/immortal they will fill for the team. Also don’t get too confident especially in 3v1 or similar situations. Work on your strafing because diamonds have decent aim but there movement isn’t too good. Strafing makes you much harder to hit so even if ur aim isn’t the best you can dodge shots to still win ur fight.
Buy another skin
Yea like shame kink, shame me daddy
Stop saying "you WILL improve" some people just don't improve with time.
Didn't know STW had a Durr Burger hero that's not Dennis
I honestly took advantage of the system. I tried ending the last act on a high mmr so when I started this act I didn't place too badly(p2>g3) even though I lost three matches and did average on the other two. Initially I faced last act high plats and low diamonds and was winning +25+30, but then was losing to high diamonds while I was g3 but my rr loses were negligible due to the higher mmr. 

I'm currently p2 playing against last act high diamonds, low ascendants getting like +26 for 8 kill games and I'm generally able to midfrag in those lobbies now that I'm used to it. So even though I'm playing against people who have peaks above me, I'm essentially stealing their rr(by a larger margin)if they weren't quick enough to get back to their original ranks(or they don't deserve it)
I'm doing the woohoojin routine and I go fade because I feel I'm more impactful than being the 4th auto lock duelist on my team. Plus her kit supplements great for scouting out and isolating 1v1 situations. I can sticky 3, rotate to flank and take the 1v1 while sending my prowler to the group fight. Ezpz
btw util can carry you a lot in valo, you probably just dont know how to use it
"he's one tap bro"
For sensitivity, I’d highly recommend downloading Aimlabs, it’s free, you can also use it to improve your aim but I never liked it as much as just playing the game. But anyways there’s a certain game mode in there that will recommend the sensitivity you should use for valorant based on how your aim currently is. So I redo it every month or so. Hopefully this helps!
people don't like aiming bc they lose the fights lol

Pretty sure I remember Tenz talking about how he uses this… idk aim placement is the meat and potatoes of this game but let’s be honest, your rank mainly boils down to how fast you can click on someone’s head.
Yeah. They are owned by tencent. American corporations have no sense of culture morals principles etc. They just see money. That's what individualism does for you baby.

my advice is for your friend to stop cheating and playing the game fairly, so he/she won't get banned next time.
Well for starters save rounds. You could use that money to buy next round or get a teammate a eco gun. At the end of the day it’s an overpriced gun that you have access to for emergencies. Yes there’s a lot of situations where something is better than just a headhunter but sometimes it’s all ya got
no im getting it from the battlepass (free) . Also i got my account back
Ah ok that makes more sense
the problem is that EPIC "Tim Sweeney" doesn't want to put work on STW, That's the only reason it will never go F2P. He wants move Fortnite into a player created content system which is not really making them any money but hey, It's not like Tim follows logic.

Pretty sure that canonically they dont want her in the field, but she's insistent enough that she's not just their healer that they cant argue back
With all respect, it is day 5, you can do whatever you want and it will probably work with good aim and gamesense from 15k hours on CS. Unless you bought your account or played 24/7 you probably are gold. Just aim alone will carry you easily up to plat, but eventually your other skills will bottleneck your progress. Eventually people will start to expect lurks or use sentinel util, with low range controllers it is even more obvious as using your smokes basically tells the enemy team you are close (either main or mid).

>I would say it seems valorant players underestimate how reliant this game is on just tactical and aiming skill than it is what agent you're playing.

That is kind of a contradiction. Lurking is to a certain degree risky. In CS anyone can buy smokes but not in valorant so if you die you leave your team without smokes which is a HUGE tactical disadvantage. With clove this is not such a huge problem as you can still throw smokes while dead but what if your team needs to rotate?
>Nope. I have seen many trap set ups that don’t involve “tunnels.”

correct because you don't need an elaborate set up thanks for agreeing with me

>Your definition simply states that it has to be well planned and detailed

I gave you the definition of elaborate so unless you have a different one thanks for playing
Turning off tracers is objectively bad
Normally if I’m playing controller, I’d go full util and classic, same with every sentinal, but for Duelist and initiator I’d go Ghost and 1 piece of util
Thank you! I’ll dig into this guide this week. 😊
They very clearly stated somewhere during Ep1 Act 2-3 that each act is going to have 1 agent and each episode is going to have 1 map, so there will be 2 agents per episode and 1 map . The only reason we missed a few agents for some of the acts is because they postponed it because of game balance , you can come back in 60 days and find yourself with the bulletproof agent . I’ll be waiting .
I do. I’m low elo solely because I don’t play competitive. I told you, me and Skye both set up and initiated for a site push, and we were solely waiting on our duelists. I understand how to play the game and the roles of each agent types. Duellists need to know that their role isn’t to lurk and get frags, is to enter.
Sometimes people bitch and moan and beg for skins the entire game once you drop them once. Or they're so skin obsessed that they throw rounds for them. Thankfully doesn't happen as often in higher elo.

this really is a hot take because i don't think many people share this opinion at all, myself included.

i have several completely mute friends who are amazing at the game and use the ping or text chat to their full advantage. 
i'm also hoh and sometimes if the programs for my audio aren't working, i go no ear buds to give my ears a break. i'm ascendent and play very well with and without my ears but not having them means i can't communicate well with my team.
and on top of all of that, men are so incredibly toxic in this game that i can talk and risk having to mute my team or i can ping/type to be able to have the information i need during a game that my teammates can provide. 

a no comms ranked queue would entirely not work either considering this is a team based game and requires communication which again pings and text chat exist! they have a whole communication menu man. just teach people to use it.
if you are really brave, just ask your teammates nicely if you can get comms since you need them so much to the point of an odd opinion.

I mean if you get 67 kills AND STILL LOSE, i'd probably still blame you. How did you manage to get so many meaningless kills. Maybe your whole team was afk as the scores was 10-13 but man,.

The change makes sense because I haven’t actually played the game in years and just have been farming vbucks. Oh well
Probably because it takes an insane amount of playtime to stay at that level (I'm talking full-time job amounts of time) and you need to take it a whole lot more serious with training and such.

At that point, the only step up is to go pro, which turns a hobby into an actual career. Once there's so much at stake, wants become musts real quick.
STW ocean turning into vegetable soup
Interesting. For example, I was talking to my wife while I was playing and didn't see any indication in the corner of the screen that I was voice chatting. Like it is on the PC, when you press "V" you can see in the corner that you are using voice chat
I do have a job yes I'm currently igl-ing for my team on premier trying it out but yes Ik I'm a bit far from thinking of it but I always have that lingering question. what if? "What if it's too late?" Been wanting to go pro since I started playing but I need to improve my skills and I will.
Did u get it I’m deesperate
Gamesense is just knowing how to respond to situations & knowing what decisions to make, usually accumulated through playtime.

Fastest way to improve gamesense imo is to pick a pro player you like who plays your agent/ a radiant 1trick of the agent you play and watch their streams & try to mimick what they do & figure out why they do those things in your free time when you arent playing. And when you do decide to play, try to imitate what they do that's outside of aiming. 

A suggestion if you main omen is that you can watch Zander & his omen VODs. if you're having a hard time following along & pinpointing exactly what they do on default & what they do situationally, you can watch a Woohoojin video doing a VOD review on pro player omen VODs (he has VODreviews on Zander's and s0m's omen). Then practice what they do through trial and error. 

https://youtu.be/9T3gaFZoN-Q?si=uW-vAcEN8BiE-rMu 

Woohoojin does breakdowns of alot of pros ranked playbooks, so its relatively easy to follow.

A really informative (& also very entertaining) streamer to watch too is Boaster. He often explains stuff (and sings) randomly in his stream & points out a lot of details in plays and mistakes.

The majority of people will downvote for awful reasons. Somebody might have negative karma because they lack tact rather than because the content of what they say is wrong. I didn't visit this guy's profile, but his comment here comes off as judgy and rude, while I'd say it's also accurate. Saying you shouldn't listen to somebody for having negative karma is 100% a braindead move
Or watch high elo games like pro play. They use callouts as well and you will get it from the context after watching some games. It helps to learn other things as well

ok if it’s your 1st FPS and ur not following guides and like doing the training routines they give and just playing, i think that’s perfectly fine honestly. Destiny 2 was my 1st FPS, and PC game, and it took me about 400-500 hours to get comfortable and be able to play properly in it. the basics thankfully transferred to val, in which it took me about 270? hours to get to gold 3. As long as your having fun just trust in the process, you’ll get there
you've got your aswer. Duo, trio, five stack, that's the way this game is supposed to be played. Solo queue is hard and necessitate a warrior mental. Play with friends it's way more cool and easier on the mind.

Bro u not gonna rank up like this 🤣🤣🤣

You said it. It's a teamplay game. So play with your team not against it.
This seems more likely, although its still bs, makes the most sense. Imagine if I was 10 away and they gave me 9 RR....lol

Then link your tracker.
yeah i mean if you can't use voice chat (eg your situation), then you can playoff others info and use ping, radial radio (idk the name but you can call for let's rotate / on my way in circle) more. Also just put your plan on text comm at start rounds like "I'm going in fast / I'm default this round". Just simple yet teammate will know what kind of play style you going to exec, so they can help.  
  
I'm just mad at those that don't talk anything at all, but use text comm to "yell" at teammates about how they don't go in / trade with them during the rounds.
what?? why is that?
I have never quite understood people’s hype on aces. Like when people get upset they got the last kill of the round and I had killed the other four I’m just like gj guys and they are like I’m sorry for stealing your ace.

She is really very good at stopping deathballs with her wall and trips. Just about every other defensive scenario, she sucks at. She can't retake, she can't anchor, she can't deal with slow play or lurkers. 

Being good at one defensive scenario doesn't mean she's good at defense. Kj and cypher both have util that is useful in all of those scenarios. Maybe they are worse at stopping a deathballs, sure, but I'm still picking someone who's good at 9/10 scenarios, rather than 1/10.
I'm mid gold and a couple days ago 2 teammates got into an argument even after a quick 4-0 start. I just had to laugh lmao. The mentals down there (and in this game in general) are some of the weakest out of any game I've played in my 20+ years of multiplayer. Could just be my tolerance of screeching 13 yr olds that's gone down though so it feels worse lol.
**No we don't.**
It can be irritating, yeah.

Read about the \*structure\* of the fight in https://www.reddit.com/r/STWguides/comments/xd3ih4/bad\_at\_the\_msk\_me\_too\_heres\_how\_i\_cope\_sort\_of/ , because it's similar to the Canny Storm King - there's approaches that will work in both fights.

i felt the same badly and i already quit the game tho coz i cant find any enjoyment there. 
I used to be Ascendant with completely solo but i promise thats not gonna be solve in any rank unless stop solo queueing. thats why pro/high ranked ppl often never recommend solo queue if you wanna rank up. 
but the thing is kinda simple, if you still enjoy the game even little bit, try improve your gameplay but otherwise, take a break or quit until you got motivation and take care of your health and life. the game is just very small part of our life. 
dont overthink.
Any 1 interested in gold 4 v bucks I can gift gold 2 U 4 v buck
Oh wow no way!!!
Yeah definitely looks like you’ve been hard-stuck. I’m assuming you’ve been doing the guide this whole time? Doing the routines? Comming in game, attempting to pre-round and mid round?

You seem to have improved slowly but surely. Trust me iron-bronze gets really easy to play against and I know you can climb out. Your K/D is extremely low as a duelist main. I’m honestly gonna assume you either arent doing the routine consistently or you have bad game sense. The routine helps with aim tremendously.

I see that your hs% is really high but your KAST is really low, meaning you dont get Kills Assists Surviving and Trades very often.

You’ve done really well improving your hs% from last act :)

You’ve improved a lot recently.

My advice is to learn good movement, simple a and d movement works just fine which is huge in iron-bronze. learn how to trade your teammates. If you don’t already, watch pro neon gameplay. Watch how to entry as a neon, what positions to take, best timing and places for your utility and etc. It just looks like you’re losing a lot of gunfights based on your kd.


I definitely think you can make it out :)
sorry man
Who knows, this isn't exactly a BR subreddit
I'm not, play who you want but don't play a character because there good. Play them because you want too. If you play only who is good. And spend all your time trying to do what other people are saying You're not learning anything. I will die on this hill. meta's destroy communitys and the people in them. It's a game your only objective should be to have fun the second your objective becomes, I HAVE to win I HAVE to get better, this game becomes a job. When that happens you get burnt out or you get frustrated, and you leave.

They just banned bot-leveled accounts so that people have to rank up to level 20 manually. This is a lot of playtime, I've done it twice so I could grind new agent pools and I won't be doing it a third.

They also use the visible rank / hidden MMR system so people who are dominating lower ranks get double+ rankups to keep them aligned with their true skill more accurately, so someone aggressively smurfing usually gets moved out of that rank quickly.

Beyond that, yes, it's unsolvable to make a system that accurately ranks people and detects all instances of smurfing, because it is super easy on a smurf account to play bad / throw a few rounds / look like you belong at that rank outside of a crucial round win or two.
You can now
> she is really a nightmare to play against. 

Quite literally. B-)
Warning - delusional People are gonna downvote this post
i agree she isn’t the best controller, i think she’ll take over omen’s spot in double controller comps and that’s abt it.
The agent is completely incapable of inspecting weapon. They only do that, with every gun/knife. Gekko flash/blind, but it's marinara sauce
if you are saying no bluetooth, does that mean my razer deathadder v2 pro is not suited for valorant gameplay?
Depends, play the modes that make you happy, there is obviously a learning curve but do what makes you happy… 

I don’t play competitive much cause somehow my mother comes into the conversation like she didn’t do shit bro chill out… but I love swiftplay and spike rush, fast matches sometimes I’m able to dominate gives a sense of winning makes me happy… somedays are just bad don’t beat yourself up for it… 


And if it just makes you mad, you can try other games, just cause most people enjoy it, doesn’t mean you have to.

I misrepresented what I meant. I don't want them to balance around silver. Reyna does have one of the highest pick rates in the game. Just surprised that all Jett abilities got nerfed and Reyna was untouched.
In response to some of the other comments, I'd say def don't play Reyna or Iso or whatever. You can learn the game, it's mechanics, the strategy while still developing your gunplay. If you want to focus on gunplay, practice in deathmatch and learn movement and aiming principles. I started the game maining controllers, shaping the battlefield to my and my team's benefit. Helped me learn everything to play other roles later on with less pressure. I'd highly recommend doing that, since it gives you the chance to focus on considering the battlefield as a whole. I'd highly recommend Omen

metal team leader has a higher HAD stat and lower health/shield stats, no? i feel like its possible some of the others have marginal differences, but people don't really care enough about them.
My fps is usually around 140, and no it’s because I might be looking elsewhere like the minimap or somewhere else instead of the crosshair, so I skip over that I saw the enemy. It’s something I caught myself doing a lot so I’m trying to fix that too

> A single molly that does less damage, and is shorter, than Brim's. (While still costing more)


Why the hell do people keep trying to compare these abilities. I wasn't aware Brimstones Molly applies Vulnerable a very strong debuff that doubles damage you take or that he had recharging smokes/decay that also adds value to damage utility.


> The shortest duration orb smoke in the game, that also can be used only in one location, that is also the hardest to position (limiting options).


You mean the largest dome smoke as well that also applies decay making pushing it a death sentence most of the time and limiting options you mean something that allows Viper several one ways that other agents can't do.


> Her ult can be really good, but is very situational, and also insanely expensive. So you're often left just holding it for a good opportunity that never comes, or wasting it.


Her ult is not situational at all do you have site or plant press it and watch as your conversion rate of the round goes upwards of 80-90%.  On defence you just rip it in a core choke and the enemy now cannot push it.




Her kit is not gutted it's still a good kit again I play a ton of Viper and she still feels fine the only change I personally don't like is the orb pickup but I can understand why they did it.
He ended up just like leagues Neace who claimed to be challenger in multiple roles and regions. Started off with solid guides, positive coaching, etc and eventually showed themselves to be an egomaniac and toxic.

Just last week or so I unbound my crouch button to punish myself for doing it rather than strafing. I'm starting to get better at steady movement rather than stopping to crouch. I blame 2k+ hours in csgo lmao.

I'm 2 rr from gold, so hopefully tonight I'll finally break silver!
Yeah I would recommend breach
I'm gonna make a suggestion that most people won't: Just stop queueing comp and make DM and TDM your main game modes for a while. You'll at some point grind yourself to a point where you'll learn good crosshair placement, react faster, and learn how to fight multi-angled encounters consistently.

While locking duelist would get you into more fights, you'd still sit around for a solid minute at a time if you die first so it's not really good practice mechanically.
I just wanna move.
Unless you are actively making money or are close to making money off valorant (or any game for that matter) it should not feel like a job. 

Personally, I’m finishing the challenges that came out today, then taking a break until the next season.

Tried checking this one out, from all matches, I have about 50% win ratio,1.04 KD with 134 ADR. With 14% HS yikes lol. Oh, and 72% KAST.
anyone can play it. You can get really good like some examples are Sintraa, TenZ and etc. You just have to reflect and think about what you did wrong after dying and think of a different strategy. Plans help as well, if your teammates dont wanna cooperate well then good luck

same here!
I had oni guardian in my previous NM. I decided against it since I don't like oni in general. Recon and rgx aren't my cup of tea and Gaia guardian doesn't look or sound as good as reaver. The only other guardian skin I'd get is ruination tho
I'm too lazy to edit out the "\[CONSOLE LOGIN\]" thingy for now, but I'm sure you'll figure out what I mean

Your \[CONSOLE LOGIN OF OP'S CHOOSING\] might be linked to a nameless account, here's how to fix the issue:

1. make a burner email, this will be useful for a later step
2. sign in to Epic with your \[CONSOLE\] login, it'll prompt you to make a new Epic account, use that burner email for it
3. unlink the \[CONSOLE\] account from your recently made Epic account
4. re-login to your main Epic account and attempt to link your \[CONSOLE\] login from there

our mode isn't even on Switch (but it ***is*** on Xbox, so you're (kinda?) all good!) though, so why on Earth would you play on a console that can't run STW?

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that came out before Battle Royale, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

* Casual Battle Royale - r/FortNiteBR
* Competitive Battle Royale - r/FortniteCompetitive
* Creative - r/FortniteCreative
* Lego - r/LEGOfortnite
* Rocket Racing - r/RocketRacing
* Festival - r/FortniteFestival
* Mobile - r/FortniteMobile (that's there so the main BR sub doesn't have to deal with the lag complaints)
* Switch - r/FortniteSwitch (for the fellas in the 30fps gang)
Riot is farming free YouTube engagement from these guys. They are literally being rewarded for ignoring them.
E7a3 iron 3
E8a1 gold 1
E8a2 plat 1
Currently diamond 2 ... But on a 8 loss streak. :(.   lmao
Well he’ll be in the next mission trying to scam someone for more brick so he can waste his doing this dumbass shit again… these fuxkin ball bags need to be lobotomized
It's more than I expected but, the fact that the techlead didn't thought about implementing a replay system in the long run when developing a competitive game makes me confused.
I mean I think that he will be to bad now (compared to the other duelist)
Personally I've only voted to draw once. I had already gone 20 minutes past my set end time and it was 15-15. I would have had to dc if the game had gone any longer to get ready for work

I'd rather draw than play a 4v5 if one of my allies was in a similar situation at that point.
I thought you were specifically talking about the new venture maps and not what they decided to do in 2020
Underrated
pretty sure i hadd it from the start but i could be wrong
having this problem for ages.
Nope lol, I stopped for a few weeks and only started playing lately :D

There was a silent nerf at one point yes. You can still move really far with it though.
big booty gyat my favorite ginger.
Bruh how is your experience so different then. It happens once in a while but most people are just good and fun. It only happened like 2 times in almost a year of playing Valorant with her.
wait i think im not clarified, what name is ur xbox gamepass thingy? mine says PC XBOX Gamepass
None 😂 Their too busy 😂 they’re broadsides
I came out of a game on sunset where a sage was sitting in spawn afk(ping wasn’t there). For the first few rounds we thought he had a client crash. He logged into the game at the last second and didn’t heal or do shit cuz “we too noob”. He kept doing this and started baiting for kills. In the end (ofc we lost) I carried and he said in vc that we shit. So this is all that I have to say. If ur a person who mains sage idgaf about literally anything about you but please get the absolute fuck of valorant or play some other agent cuz all you guys say are “meow or bark for heals” “I have a boyfriend” . So if you main sage and see this comment I hope you have a horrible day and lose all ur ranked games until you quit sage.
america
>If you win that round you’re in the right

True here but not true in general, plenty of terrible plays end up in victory, the phenomena of the 3 division gap 1v1 where the gold player wins the 1v1 vs an immortal player just off of being stupid is common
All of them
Exactly, the whole point of this game is not to just take 1v1s every round, it’s to make gunfights unfair by using numbers, utility and positioning. If all you’re doing is trying to aim-duel opponents each round, you’re not putting your team in the best position to win.
Bro 😂😂😂

By all means if it helps you rank up do it. But I'd suggest you to stop doing it once you reach b3-s1 kinda elo. It gets easier as you get better teammates and people atleast play with a Lil bit of brain. And your setups will get you free kills, you won't need to rush into stuff and shit. Will help you main the agent in the long run too.
As people have been saying ASC is the highest you can get placed. From my experience win or lose after a reset I will get placed a full rank down, for example if I ended on asc 3 I will get diamond 3.

Boaster if you want to improve as a player, s0m if you want to push your rank
Just confirming u/Craft-Sea that it's the sound a Taker makes when spawning. I just heard this three times in one mission; twice it was when a storm tornado appeared and a Taker burst out, the other was during a Storm Chest when I got to the Mist Monster phase.
Lol
Wheres the option “I FUCKING QUIT VAL DUE TO RIOT BEING UNABLE TO FIX SMURF ACCS” ?
It’s satisfying to me
Would be nice to get a Code, i am playing solo :)
They got the capcut editors on this one 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️
same mine crashes as soon as i start harvesting materials basically, it's not my pc either as literally every other game i have no problem with, just stw and i have 16gb ram
way too low. How are you dodging flashes? For 1000 dpi, I would say around .25-0.6 for sens is the optimal range
You say that and then continue to disagree with every comment, calling you out for shooting too early.

Don't think you are curious. I think you want people to agree with you and make fun of the "precise gunplay" meme.

Play with every agent so that you know how to play (when necessary) and you have a idea about it's do and can't do (like telling skye to heal herself)

The first thing you should know that to have fun while playing don't stress if can't kill it's ok shit happens
Even sova has voice line for this "If you're not a good shot today, don't worry. There are other ways to be useful."
You went wrong by watching Woohoojin, a self-proclaimed "radiant coach" who cant even get into radiant himself. 

Dont "practice" at the same time ur doing ranked.

Warm up before ranked, then do 2-4 ranked, and then AFTERWARDS you might want to add some aimtraining, but favourably on another time.
No
Mah, I'm 36 and still have.... I'm not sure the word is fun, but I play the game often enough. It's just how you think about it. I'm bad and I'm probably not going to get much better, but I'm having a good enough time to bring me back.
just aim on the leaves that i aimed with my crosshair that's all it is <3
First of all, very excited to try this game out.  I’m on Xbox and no friends so I’ll be sharing all 4 if I get invited 😎

what temperature is harbour’s water ahh question
riot added penalties for dodging agent select because it was likely more often than not abused. when you press play, you're committing time to play a match, and the enemy team is just as likely, if not more likely, to have bad teammates. 

riot already took the stance that free dodging is more harmful to player experience and competitive integrity, so the penalty for remaking should be increased to align with the precedent they set. also, remaking should be viewed as a bigger offense than dodging agent select because the match has started.

Even in gold I don’t feel like I’m smurfing, especially these days. I’ve only been above diamond 2 a few times and peaked asc 1 for like 3 matches, multiple episodes ago. My aim isn’t great, I usually have to rely on gamesense and luck. I also always solo queue and never tanked my rank on purpose to smurf.
yeah it’s turned on, i just don’t receive any of the callouts
Yes I was thinking the same, because in diamond there are usually comms and I can play with the team but in plat there is just nothing. Its like playing with an iron team but everyone can aim.

Deadlock's Barrier Mesh - Takes forever to break (let's not forget they reduced the ammo on Phantom and Vandal)

Deadlock's Ultimate Ability - It's Homelander (can barely break it) 

Gekko's Ultimate Ability - Again pain in "you know where" to break that

Meanwhile riot be like let's ignore all that and give a hard nerf to Jett and other stable agents.
PS: I'm not a jett player.
Lemme tell u priority wise  


1. **Lotus**
2. **Haven**
3. **Sunset**
4. **Split**
5. **Icebox**
6. **Fracture**
7. **Ascent**
8. *~~^(Breeze)~~*
How is Viper being used this much? I thought the nerf was bad enough that Viper would be unusable.

Happens one game a week for me. Are you sure you’re not playing into the troll and giving them the response they want? 
Cause devs and smurfs are delusional that she’s somehow not bad for the game in almost every way.
Checked afterword, lost by a round.
The disc alone allows you to get into STW (no purchase required) but wont give you Founders status (nor grant vBucks with missions), the code that came with it gave Founders.
Thanks for taking me seriously. I am not being a troll or doing to get attention from the community. I only want mod attention and they don’t answer modmail. 

I’m not advocating for BR or festival posts or anything like that. I feel the rules need to be updated for 2024 and the state of the different game modes due to their popularity. Better moderation, stricter flair requirements and so on. 

But without the mods actually acknowledging these things no changes will happen. Even when my posts are removed, I do t get any sort of message that they were removed or why. Every other sub I’ve been in tells you at least.
I'm not being passive aggressive, if you can't handle disagreement I don't know what to tell you. The game is plenty fun, the player base is massive. They don't need to implement everything other games have.

Clip
Would rather not have seen it. It was discovered very quickly being the highest rank in the game even by a small margin meant you had an insane amount of elo to lose. I remember winning games and being middle of the pack and deranking because the system was heavily weighted on personal performance.
I'm bronze and I can out aim irons 95% of the time.
They downvote cause they subjectively disagree, not because they think I'm lying(which I'm not. I don't spit fire, I spit facts cause I'm not a rapper. Which is also facts), anyway. Using the downvote button as a "I disagree/Dislike" button is against reddit rules.

It's meant to to allow filtering for posts and comments, upvoted "factual" content gets seen more and things that: Posts that has nothing to do with the subreddit in question or comments that has nothing to do with the post gets downvoted to filter them away.

Most people don't know this however, considering they never read the rules to begin with. I have. I've also done my research and everything I've found points to me being correct.

1st round Was eco for them? Nevertheless good job!
Don’t go extreme and go one sensitivity up try to get it higher little by little like try going up to 0.22, 0.23, and so on
At best one before games, if I feel spicy I'll do dm after the games too
please watch arcane
I haven't received either the 'LOUD' title or the gun buddy.

thanks bro will do and yea i will try to give aim labs a try then if this is the case and btw i had asked that same "friend" before on how he has good aim and if he uses aim lab at all  and he said "nothing bro its just skill, get good" and he said he doesn't use range so do you think hes lying?

Thats what people need to understand. If you lose its your fault, if you win its your fault as well. One win will not make a difference on your rank, but improving will. Improving and having fun improving should always be the focus
The consept is unique but most likely really toxic in the end. I can already see the bottom frag Reyna lurking screaming to res her. 

Also I can't believe you're still a sage main after everything you have to deal with on a daily basis. I support you
No, and day by day we see this game becoming more unplayable. Enjoy while you can my man, 'cause i doubt it in the next years this game will be available anymore.

Thankfully the shops have been so trash lately that I’m sitting on 10k+ vbucks. Hopefully this will hold me over until or close to September
that’s definitely valid
Read chat
Lol what even is this
Me neither but I'd say fade is probably more dangerous if u don't have good duelist and if ur solo queing u most likely won't.
Yah and thats like a billion times better than what OP is right now, Im just saying its possible to be comfortable on a high sens and play at a high level. If you dont think GC world championship is high level then youre delusional.

W8 what? What imitation sound?
Honestly I loveee breeze 🙈🙈 I loved it before they made all the new changes and it was horrible to play on when they closed hall off. All you need is good viper lineups tbh and it's a blasttt
Flash AC + Bio-Energy Source with Tac Sledge, First Shot Rio, Ambush Buzz, Chaos Agent and Fallen Love Ranger. Use with Dirge Song and Blackout with CR, 2CD, RS and the reloadsplosions sixth. Phase shift then fire, rinse and repeat.
Never being hard stuck, seems like you are unable to identify your mistakes or you are just super casual and play for the interaction with your teammates idk. 

However, if your playing to rank up and you cant YOU are the problem and you need to find areas to improve on.
Dude I think you just hate iso and/or lost a few ranked games and are pissed.

Take a chill pill and read that mess of a paragraph again, and realize how much of your ego and stupidity are seeping into your words.
You're not alone. I run with no sound at all half the time 🙂

It's an easter egg of sorts. If you'd never heard the dialog, of course you'd miss the joke.
Yes I reset my Xbox and now the problem has been fixed
Because it does, tyvm
Nice man. It took me like a year to get to plat 3
Yes I think the shield time will reset if you shot the orb
Enlighten me then so I don't get the facts wrong.
The main idea playing defense on Icebox is plant denial because retake is so diffiicult for most players. KJs mollys are great for that. This is especially true for pro-play, but also true for most games in gold or higher. People might not put it into words, but watch gold and plat level games, probably a lot of failures in retakes unless you have someone who is smurfing or has better mechanical skill than all their opponents and just frag out. 

Meta on attack is usually 4 main and 1 lurk mid. Usually want to use a bot on mid to give info on lurks, I see alot of KJs use the window from kitchen to put alarmbot down where the enemy Vipers usually orb in mid. Then hold onto both mollies and put turret watching near B site default plant and molly off of that from nest where you can keep an eye on kitchen lurks. Or you can use turret for kitchen and then just jump peak and/or listen for B hit.  Her ult is pretty solid for retake and attack. 

She is better than Cypher bc he has no plant denial and his trips are best for bottlenecks which Icebox doesn't really have(too much verticality). Better than Deadlock bc Deadlock is hot shit. Chamber is only good if you can frag out and get aggro bc he has no plant denial. That leaves Sage who has no flank/lurk watch util and no plant denial. KJ is easily the best sentinel for that map, even if you're not playing pro-level strats.
Xbox isnt even releasing on xbox
Jett is still the best duelist.
Same with kj, nerf her all you want she still had the best sentinel kit

They were mad about epic releasing the stw pack hero as a normal vBuck outfit in the Item Shop. And I totally get them, Epic wanted them to use even more money to use that same character appearance in Fortnite BR. To overcome this, they should let the packs contains both the hero and outfit.

And everytime Epic Games takes a STW hero and release it as an outfit in the Item Shop, it should be a free outfit for STW players

I don't know what rank you are but according to Blitz.gg Neon's and Iso's pick rate range from like 1.4 to 0.8% or something, they're at the very very bottom from Radiant to like Gold 3.
Plankerton doesn't have frequent malachite spawns, so having tier 3 schematics before Canny Valley doesn't make that much sense.

You can still 'down-craft' your schematics to use your lower tier resources like Silver ore in this case.

1. Instead of crafting the item select 'Crafting Options', You'll see this button towards the bottom of your inventory screen.
2. Use the stars to choose which level to craft the weapon at. The options available depend on the evolution of the schematic itself.
Imma be the one to say this this should be fact not my opinion it doesn't matter what hero u play as long as u contribute I can be a green soilder pl 45 no one else in. Loadout and still place some traps defenders and shoot and help out doesn't mean I should get shit on for what i play more of how I play
You are definitely right, "peeker's advantage" is a big challenge to deal with, however the gunplay behavior I mentioned is present in the game regardless of "peeker's advantage". I've tested it many times and I encourage you to do the same, I sometimes get those kills on my end as well.
>My first two vandal shots hit but shots 3 and 4 are in the stratosphere.

That's why you don't want to shoot more than 2 shots before strafing.

There are many reasons why you get onetapped often. Bad movement, bad positioning, peeking the same angle more than once, standing in the same spot on defense more than one round. 

Focus on one thing to improve, until you can do said thing subconsciously without thinking about it.

 I'd start with movement, because without movement, you can't really practice aim. Learn to strafe and aim by strafing (basically not moving your crosshair while strafing and learning to stop and shoot at the time your crosshair is on their head). If you can do this, you can learn deadzoning and proper gunfight technique.

When somebody peeks you, you need to shoot 1-2 bullets and strafe immediately. Most people just stand still and whiff every shot.

Aim is mostly crosshair placement. Get your sens as low as possible (+-200 EDPI) and play a shit ton of deathmatch to practice common angle and crosshair positioning. Aimlabs is imho a waste of time exept tracking excersises. Those are important. Tracking is everything, flicking is overrated AF.
Ah my bad, you were countering what the first dude said (and it’s wrong too), I read the wrong comments. Sorry for that 😁

Ofc Getting a coach is the easiest way to improve but for your goal I'd suggest to rank up to plat/dia on your own because your basic mechanics need work.I coached my hardstuck low elo friends and some random players and got them to rank up at least 3 divisions in 4-5 weeks and  I can say that free coaches are Good enough for you if you put your mind to it. 
1.Start watching YT valorant coaches like Charlatan, dopai woohoojin.
2. Start watching pro player vods and see what makes them good(for example: watch aspas to learn raze). 
3. Start doing aim training in game and in aimlabs. I always suggest voltaic for aim training, so just go to their discord find their valorant guide and start playing benchmarks with aim routines 
4. Most importantly you need to vod review yourself and analyze your gameplay without blaming teammates or bad luck (because sometimes it's your fault).
Dam that sucks
This is amazing, how tf this ain't viral
Well this patch hopes to fix some of that, fingers crossed (still waiting for Astra buffs please god Riot)
Ascent is a litmus test whether you good or bad at valorant
this number of fps is playable but if you can afford 144hz monitor that would be ideal
That's pure evil

Yea. And if you take your first fight and either miss or get one scoped, dont be afraid to hip fire that mug. Cant tell you how many sites ive held on eco just blasting hip fires into smoke. If youre still its scary accurate too, crosshair on the head gives you a really good chance to kill a full buy opponent even hip fired. For the price, the damage it does is crazy.
Yeah afks are annoying but system gets more fucked if people exploit rr reduction as a party by leaving intentionally

I found myself needing a lighter wireless mouse after using the g502 (idk if thats the right number bur it's a heavy large mouse)

I went for the g pro superlight. Its fucking awesome. I lost out on being able to swap mouse profiles on comand and the infinite scroll wheel. But its very light and easy to use.

Highly recommend. Its wireless but you can use it wired too and it has a 3 day charging life.
I would try r/riotgames.

Reddit. Well, my University’s subreddit. I made a post asking for friends, he thought I was a guy and we met up after class on campus. He said he thought I was really cute and I mentioned I played Val but I’m bronze 2. And he said he plays Val too and we duo’d and turned out he is immortal 3 and boosted my main to ascendant 2 and we are bf/gf going strong for 2 years.
honestly, comp mentality seems to be snowballing. the amount of people who complain about smurfs, throwers, trollers etc. just seems to be getting higher and higher, which with the rise can introduce "copycats" or with mental as a whole going down, have people care less / troll/ throw because it's hard to care for a game where often times it may feel like it's spitting in your face
We figured it out, you have to be signed into Epic on the browser first

Being scared to Q comp. Such a weird moment now idc and well I play better not worrying about my movement every second
Maybe you should stream your games and teach me how to hit radiant?
Add me
Vacuum tube bow is better than xenon bow in my humble opinion. Save the world is basically all i play now. Battle Royale is just too darn slow.
No
I've had the same issue happen to me after reporting a bug. The way I seem to fix it is by being knocked down in game by husks or any other means of losing all your health. Hope this helps anyone else having this problem!
The biggest issue is that the game keeps smurfs to force you losses. Every time, without fail, i only go on loss streaks with some douchebag with over 500 acs at the top of the leaderboard.

Btw, I actually think these are closet cheaters, not smurfs, because their movement is complete ass but their “awereness” is better in silver than what i get in dia asc lobbies. No replay system to cover up the massive amount of cheating rampaging in this game since sep 2022.
i don’t think it does, but if you send another request right after and it doesn’t say “friend request sent” they either didn’t get the first one, denied it, or have auto decline on
I've done this with other software and it only mutes my discord audio, i'm trying to mute my friends audio
Southie is still “fixed” too this will be Ventures a HUGE PAIN

How the hell am I supposed to farm or Recycle Animal drops for mats now!?
First I spam the orb and try to summon their return. Then if they don't, I tell myself that the orb is worth more than they are and that we're gonna win the 4 v 5 without them and in spite of them. Get your team hyped and play your asses off. Rarely works but that once every so often that you win shorthanded and it feels awesome. Just don't let it break your mental. The outcome no longer matters when you're missing a player and you need to be ok with that. Yeah it sucks but competitive or not it is still a game and you can't give it power over you

Iron 1 -> Asc 3

Been playing on and off since release. ~1500 hours
Thank you!
stop worrying about it too much maybe playing with your friends to reduce stress might help. Before every match remind yourself that all you can loose is digital points that doesnt even matter and you will do better next time because you're improving
* \+30 Crit Rating
* \+30 Damage
* Physical +20%
* \+135% Crit damage

I don't even have Stoneheart, but I can say it's one of the most cost efficient weapons I've ever used
It also goes off how many 2,3,4, and 5ks you get
You really thought you did something LOL
Creating an account from scratch and endure the first 20 level in unrated or spike rushes for an alternate account does not count as smurfing imo.

Riot still matchmakes your uncalibrated comps using your hidden MMR from your unrated and spike rushes K/D. So it's all fair if you yourself make an alt and do whatever Iron to Radiant content.

Buying an iron acc just to stomp games on the other hand...
now that it's pointed out to me brim does move his hand like hes a wizard
If you have friends that play or just play with fill on donhit the road for fossil southie
Thanks
Forsaken op?
Would you look at that, another vbuck question lol.
People on the internet are hypocritics
exactly, site is just made for 5 agents and 5 agents ONLY..
I do have it zoomed all the way out and I look at it when I can. How do I know when it’s safe to look though I’ve been killed by valorant timing so many times
Let me know your thoughts in the comments. If this helps, upvote for the UW brothers ! And as for if I've seen any competetive advantage to this ... uhhhh.. maybe.
Quests is your best option and prob the only one.
Sounds selfish as fuck lol. Idc if the other team that just wanted to have fun is having fun, I only care if I’m having fun the way I want to. Yeah there are worse things than playing valorant against a guy with 150 ping, there’s also much worse things than having to make an alt to play with friends lol
mf’s said refill chambers q 😭😭
It's your internet, brah. You need to fix that.
ATTACK THE D SITE!!!!
So like a much faster and streamlined comp?
In my opinion Breach has his skill ceiling held back by map and coordination. If we’re talking ideal circumstance breach has immense potential, if we’re talking about just solo queue or something it will drop that ceiling a bit.
I remember when I first started playing valorant and all I do is play cypher and study lineups from Peak. My friends who've had like 100 hours of valorant already were grateful despite my bad aim. It was the reason why they want to play with me and why I have friends to play valorant with.
No it isn't its just a giga wide swing
Bro I nearly went onto your profile in class to look for the post about the least fav maps, nsfw warning just saved me from years of embarrassment
yeah, this sub is a massive cope, get smurfed on? vent here, got a hacker for the first time in 900 hours? vent here.

People just complain here and will make u think people hate the game but they don't, they're just tilted, they will be queueing tomorrow.
I agree with you and I have tried to quit. It's just hard
Looking for a PS5 code if any spare. Thanks so much.
Bro that's some jujutsu kaisen level stuff.
Bugs aren’t fun but the development team for save the world is so small at this point that I think we should just be glad they’re still putting something new out for us. They’ll fix them eventually… I hope lol
Yeah, it's well known that the early seasons of br reused assets from stw for cheaper processes.
i've only see this happen in BR tbh

The amount of Lynx players in 160 PL missions is outrageous.
I’ve also heard that ascendant is basically the silvers of high elo. As an ascendant, I can confirm.
That's OK, I played terrible no matter the circumstance.
I don’t see zombies on the other end of that scope
My chances of getting to Radiant these act are 50/50. I either do or I don't.
[deleted]
What's to learn?
There is no reason for someone in iron to be using these trackers.  It is going to tilt you more than help you
If you love Val, then go for it. Just know, you’ll want to spend more $ on skins and that knife you may get “bored” of eventually
I don't play without headphones lol, it's probably the audio software i use (Nahimic) to equalize louder sounds so that i can hear footsteps but gunshots don't rupture my eardrums.


It's weird though, it sounds somewhat different but not like what you're describing to me.
Never got mine
Yup! Can you build to the otherside and as you’re falling. Use Lynx for the ninja hangtime to help float down to the floor that you build.
Tyy!!!
The only Valorant YouTube content I really enjoy is royalg, and even then i watch it cuz he's funny, not for the Valorant content.
Try starting a mission and hit a rock with a sword, then the surround pound, you will see that the surround pound does more damage to rocks, and the storm king's horn counts as a rock
Mine was stuttery and didn't play the music. Had to watch it on YouTube, sadly.
Yes... 100% it does.

but it isn't impossible. You just have to know that it is harder, depending how high your ping is of course.
Man terrible skin
I switched from KJ main to Phoenix at one point. I don’t know why you don’t want to play Phoenix if you are doing very well on him. You’re Gold 3, you should be playing whoever you do best on to rank up.
It does, but also affects packet loss, which I want to avoid. Sure, using something like NordVPN is way better than some others, but it is still not preferable for this situation
reyna, the ppl who play her are obnoxious
I just don’t have enough time to play and maintain a consistent level of gameplay - when I had more time to play I peaked ascendant 3 (85RR~) and now I’m Diamond 3 - Asc 1. My aim is just off sometimes to the point I can’t kill any enemy. I also play a lot of controllers and that is a downside alone 💀
So is Neon’s slide supposed to be worse on console? Like the ready up time on console really bad, like she kept her 2 slides buff but not the ready speed?
And your point is?
you can play any skill level in unrated, no? i thought that was the whole point of unrated
I think they will reuse Blade animation for 2024 or copy Kuronami's
Daily challenges rewards boost gave me a reason to play now sooo
fr lol
Be happy to be there, it’s when the games grind becomes more full filling. Reaching ur end game goals feels like ur so much closer to victory. Trying new builds at their very best, begins in twine. 

The best advice I can give u is, enjoy it, be proud of urself, not as many people as u think get to twine before quitting the game. Ur doing a good job, keep it up 🙂🍻

"Learning flex" below immortal means you're just bad at everyone. Stick to 1 or 2 max unless you're high elo.
[removed]
Yeah its just boring 😴  not worth the time to play 10/10 no longer care about ranks.
Zander vods.
for the 1 billionth time. (don't worry its not personal lol)  

it's not how MUCH you practice.    it's what you are practice.

as someone said here a few weeks ago.

practicing aimlabs,  will make you good at aim labs,  not valorant, get your butt in DEATHMATCH for actual valorant head clicking experience. aimlabs is good for warm-ups or people brand new to mouse. but it isn't the end all be all. 

  it(deathmatch) will suck ass at first, but you will get better.      i have about 5 hours of Deathmatch, and i've gone to iron 1 aim, to bronze 2 aim.   slivers still clap me, but i can keep up with them depending on the slivers.   i went 11-15 in a sliver lobby as an iron 3.  who knows  another 5 hours of DM and i might have sliver aim.  doubt. but you see the point lol 

and i hate to be the Parrott for this.     but you should really watch woohoojin videos,    

start with gun hygiene, and then do gun hygiene (all weapons), and then honestly? 

 just watching his vod reviews of higher ranked players will help a toooon.  i don't really like his coaching style. but it works.  click annnny video from the last 9 months and i am sure you will learn something.
I think it depends on the monitor? Not sure. So far it a capped at 60 frames for me. Maybe if I get a 120 htz monitor it might go up? Not sure
[removed]
If you wanna climb. Draw a dot with a sharpie on ur monitor and play with no crosshair. Best for sure. 
Source : trust me bro
Practice only bursting/tapping in DM with vandal. Takes conscious repeated effort to change your instinct. 

Having proper crosshair placement and movement will also encourage bursting/tapping by default.
Had a jet that aced 13 rounds in a row only onetaps.

The game didnt show the redscreen..

And I have never seen a redscreen and I have played since the beta.

PL130+ spamming open broadsides in Frostnite. When we poited it out they are asking "what are broadsides?". Not sure if someone gave their account to their kid or the guy was trolling.
How does my material count look suspicious lol. Also pretty sure there was more behind me not sure tho didn’t take a screenshot of the rest
You started a month ago,why do you have tracker? delete tracker you don't need that,youre just shatering your mental before you even start the game,delete tracker and play the game.
Try doing the various quests and do daily quest in both battle royale and Reload you'll get 60000 XP from each mode after completing 3 daily quests.

You'll also gain roughly 20000 XP just from playing Reload and you'll get some XP playing in lego mode, you could also do the quests there and in festival to gain some extra XP.

You have until late August I think to level up
Yeah I try to be mindful when playing with others. If I wanna use healing pads, I'd even walk a few tiles away before placing them. In case teammates wanna slap down tar pits closer to the objective.
Idk about streaming,

But woohoojin posts education Val which I think is helpful
you being bothered by this legible picture speaks volumes, wah wah
>	hardstuck iron

That’s actually impressive. It’s harder to get into Iron than it is Silver.
There’s a difference between a player performing well in YOUR rank, and a player clearly on a higher skill level than everyone else

Dropping 38 and 13 is crazy, that person is either having the game of their life or definitely in a higher rank. Those kind of stats aren’t consistent in every of valorant and can usually be attributed to smurfing, but yea that’s it!
For the first time, I thought that too. She says calm in a weird way.

Xenon bow just has a massive hit box compared to the other bows
I played her on Haven A site in a 2v1, shot my ult right before i got one tapped, then somehow the fade broke out. i assume she got caught on some boxes and it broke the cocoon, since i shot it from the opposite side of site to sewers (where she was). When she got out my Reyna was in such shock that she lost the 1v1 lmao.
You mean a players who's playing only for V-Bucks?
Personally, I think she's fun to play but is very much centered on teamplay and minimally communications. She has a lot of really fun combos with other characters with mollies and blinds, but to get the most out of her you either have to swing on your own trips or communicate with your team about locations, especially when her trip goes off.

Speaking of util, she has to be probably one of the most fun Sentinels to play with. Her trips are a slightly weaker Cypher trip since they are set off by sound, but in low elo where everyone sprints it has a lot of bearing and if placed right can be a great way to slow flanks down. Her wall gives you area denial and the fact that you can shoot through gives a lot of great swing potential. I feel her grenade is a bit weak since crouching and slow down doesn't mean much at low elo but maybe in higher level play it's a great way to combo off others.

Her ult though, is incredibly fun and I do love how some predicted half-jokingly that no one will shoot the cocoon out, because the times I've trapped people it usually ends in them dying, except for maybe 1 or 2 occasions so far (at least in game, in TDM they usually shoot out the cocoon).

Overall, pretty fun to play, a little mechanically difficult since you'll need to manually place the wall and know some grenade lineups, but an otherwise nice addition to the roster.

Also holy shit her agent select animation is fire.
Girls don't play valorant.

I've been playing for a long time and I thought this was the game's way of determining if I truly deserve a certain rank by putting me against players one rank higher to see if I can beat them consistently and if I cannot then I'll have to be one rank lower coz I'm not fit for that rank yet.

Should I be mad on this system? I don't know...
Crouch spammers are so annoying.
Its been almost 2 years since I played and the game still has the same problems that ppl complain since beta. A lot of people have left and if it continues like this it will die, dont doubt it
Spline is the coolest skin set, idc what anyone says.
100ms w/ comms. Comms is essential to the game. Also most ppl don't even hit their first bullet, so even with 100 ping as long as you're first shot acc is good, and you aren't super high rank, you're prob fine.
you can see your average stats in the overview tab and then switch it to all acts. If you click one of those stats like KAST, you'll get your best matches according to your KAST on the right side of your screen

Nope. I should. Currently peaked silver 3 (fairly decent stats for my rank, and for some reason my swifts are full of Plat through Immortal and I can hold my own). 
I play with a few veryyyyy casual (and not great at the game) bronze players so I never really feel behind on my aim which I believe is bad for my play since I am never really playing good competition in comp when I’m with my stack.
I really wanted to play r6 extraction. Is it worth the money? And how is it compared to valo in the gameplay

If we don’t get a new STW bug after every update we might as well go and buy a lottery ticket
I would say you need to be a little attentive and put a little more concentration in the game. You always seem to be a little lost and don’t know what to do after the first kill. Be sure to decide what to do after killing the guy . Doesn’t matter if it is the right decision, you will know it after a few tries.
Yeah ofc they will! They gotta please Honey the Pooh
Idk how you’ve been playing since Act 3 and HARD stuck bronze 3, but call yourself “great at the game” something is definitely off. Post Tracker.gg
"They are X" is only a good comm if its a response to you dying, and even then its worse than "agent is A"
I’ve played close to 1,800 hours of CS and 200 hours of Valorant. Valorant is so much more toxic. Both enemies and teammates.

I get Match MVPs on Astra and I love seeing my name, and knowing that it's on everyone's screen. I think it's a matter of opinion at this point but I can see your points making sense as well.
Yes!! I agree:3 I’m playing on Frankfurt servers! And yeah we’ll see how it goes!! So far it’s going well:) And 100% sleeping well and being healthy in general affects how you perform
True, adding the beam pistols is a must for the character. Maybe with infinite ammo and enhanced precision?
I would recommend trying to learn the movement and shooting mechanics (as unlike in other games you cannot move and shoot at the same time) before working on your aim (you will hear people mention warmups, this is when you go into an aim trainer or the range and practice their aim before playing matches) and then trying to find an agent that works best for you (if you play cs:go kayo will work best for you as his flash is the CSGO flash and his molly is a CSGO grenade and he has the ability to stop abilities from being used)

Eh it’s a hobby, I’m not trying to join the nba but I practice playing basketball a lot because it’s fun and I like getting better, it’s the same thing with competitive games. It’s fun to compete and get better and that’s all the motivation a lot of people need.
I wouldn’t be so sure! Vulnerable nade could combo with a lot of util. I could also see clove being insane as a lurk while your team fakes the other site with a second controller. They get value or die on lurk? Okay, lurk’s dead, let’s rotate to stop that hit. Except they’re hitting where clove died and still have extra smokes. Even as a solo smoker, clove can comfortably just fight mid every round to drop primary smokes and still have outside reach on both sites if defeated. 

I anticipate clove’s versatility creating a lot of potential strats. Maybe they turn out bad at top level play, or maybe some insane tech gets cooked up that flips the meta.
This is interesting.

Your tracker makes no sense.

You should be actively making progress per act.

There is something seriously wrong with your playstyle it seems.
Oh wow
you're massively over leveled it's not a big deal
Am phoenix, can confirm blind firing the angle works, lol
Short answer: most likely. If you're providing more value than the average silver player, you'll rank up. At least, that's true in solo Q. Since you're duo Qing, it means that you and your duo has to provide more value than 2 average silver players. Therefore, there is a possibility that your duo is the reason. Either way, you should focus on improving your own gameplay, and if you really care about rank more than playing with friends it may be worth just solo Qing without your friend.
Use an outlander on resupply missions! I always get it done that way solo
Well the name could always be changed. Personally I'm not very good with names and just kinda slap something on these agent concepts of mine. 

As for the extra gun, yeah there is overlap but its not like overlapping abilities are nessecarly a bad thing if they feel different enough, for example both yoru and omen have a teleport but they're purpose is to do different things, or think of literally every molotov ability in the game.

With alot of my agent concepts at least half of the abilities basically start out as "what if it was x ability but more tailored for y situation" or "what if it was x ability mixed with y ability" (example, what if it was chamber headhunter but more versitile? Or the ultimate was what if it was kay/o ult mixed with brimstone stim beacon?).

So there ends up being alot of situations like this. I've just kinda accepted that while the individual components of each agent arnt wholly original the complete package should feel unique enough to be worthy of being its own character, like, imagine a lego set, you could build it the intended way or you could use all the same parts to make something entirely different, yeah people will say that they have the same colors or similar parts but that is to be expected, it is not necessarily a flaw imo.
I just need one more code to be able to five stack with the homies :(
im experiencing this rn in 2024
Its in beta rn
Yeah, I meant trying in places that it would become common to attach them to, Kinda like other utilities like Cyp tripwire, KJ alarm bot, would need to come up with multiple spots

How do you know that your skillset is on par with Golds? If you're stuck in a rank, you belong in it. Anyone stuck in a particular rank belongs in it. To you the reason might be hardware based, in fact playing with 50-60 FPS and 60HZ display does set you back alot. But just saying that your teammates hold you back is a timeless classic. It's easier to blame anything or anyone else than yourself.

I bet that if you're stuck for long enough in Iron, you belong there. Hardware limitations you have is a factor for sure, but more than that is probably your own skill.

Id take gecko over Skye personally. Gecko can get off two or more flashes at no cost. Having an extra person up to defend during plant is nice, it also saves the team from util dmg if people use mollies to deny. The ult can be farmed like crazy. if you ult during a round, get orb, plant, a kill and die your 4/7.
Shoot me an add in game KayKona#42069 I’ll help develop some strategies and get that aim a little crispier.

bro just casually says that this is in between 7 ranks lol
Im s2 rn and only ppl im facing are golds or diamonds (they have that act tag on them but their rank is silver). Why is riot putting diamonds and golds in silver lobbies??? Its so frustating, im trying so hard but i get one tapped or sprayed down. I dont seek engagement and try to hold angles but those mfs peek and crouch while wide swinging. There is nothing that i can do against that. 

Before i was playing well and pretty much always went postive or neutral now i struggle to get 10 kills.
No point if you’re decided already I was just aiming to help with your decision

My original point was that even though Reyna is good in ranked, it's bad when everyone is the exact same skill since you can't get value. It's why you don't see it in pro play but in ranked play where skill varies.
You’re not wrong but also the way the shop works is inherently anti consumer. Most people’s anger is based on the premise of companies shouldn’t take advantage of their customers which isn’t an uncommon sentiment even if you don’t agree with it. Some examples

-if a skins profit margin based on current prices is 20 to 1 or they make $20 for every 1 dollar spent to develop the skin, most people would say that means skins are too expensive (this is not to say they’re too expensive from an economics stand point but the idea of fairness to the consumer). If the profit margin was closer to a dollar per skin then consumers could at least say “well they charge that much because they’re barely making a profit”. In that case the price would make sense.

-the store operates on a false sense of scarcity to encourage people to buy more. Riot almost certainly makes more money on the whales that have given into this scarcity mind set than the individuals who just want to occasional skin or two, which is why valorant uses this model instead of leagues open store model. It creates fomo and impulse buys for new bundles. And if you’re a new player who wants an old skin? Well fuck you, good luck having it show up. I’ve personally been waiting for the Neo frontier sheriff **since February**. 

So yeah the game plays exactly the same and it’s even free. But you would think riot would want to support their players if only to foster a better customer business relation. Instead we have this predatory model that, while it makes them money I’m sure, is basically a middle finger to everyone that isn’t willing or able to shell out literal thousands of dollars for skins.

I play judge very frequently and I use it until the enemy gets smart.

Sometimes this results in me buying a judge for the entire game.

Don’t worry about the enemy team (or your team). Play what you want and have fun.
"that has never happened to me"
im not you.

"i either ignore them"
i do, they dont take the hint.

"i am fine with or without skins"

im not insecure, im annoyed.

I had a game last night (last placement match) where a dude would take spike constantly rotate around until he died or we killed the enemies - intentionally threw bomb defuses and would blind us as we pushed in. Hope that guys stubs his big toe :(
🎶*I just lost my dog*🎶
you can't depend on your teammates to play the game properly until about diamond, so as unfair as it is you are kinda expected to get about a 3k every round. if you consistently work on aim and mechanics though this won't be something super difficult, u jus have to prioritise improving and building good habits rather than winning games.
One important decision is when to use wingman for planting or for helping teammates. 

Wingman is like a boombot. It should not only plants it should also help your teammates like entering site.
Hate when that happens and I used to trade because I wanted to be nice… I stopped because else ppl like these never learn and will keep annoying you.
I just have a 10min aimlabs routine that i do before ranked. Static clicking, micros, floatshots, dashshots, reflexshot. Maybe do a dm
shii go talk to those other valorant players then they def got a lot going on at home
Hey, so the easiest thing I can say is you're peeking the wrong angles. Or atleast peeking in a wrong enough way that their crosshair is directly coming on your head.
Second thing is you're not rotating on time or being over aggro. Third is you're always focused on what util to use when rather than focusing on the mini map and aim. It's ultimately an fps game, and shooter game.

If you want coaching or joint coaching with frod here, I'd be happy to help. I'm dia-asc here, but it's mainly your aim that you can work on and get out of iron bronze elo. 

But I'd happily suggest you to talk to your gf once. As she's really good at the game, she'll also give very similar advice to you as we would.
How would you be notified about the incident? 🧐
Brimstone and Viper are the founders of the VALORANT PROTOCOL,  
omen is not american i guess  
so first american agent introduced is gekko
look at the first screenshot again

if you're too blind to notice, 580 > 500
Bruh Astra was already nerfed, you didn't have to nerf her even further. Riot pls fix
thats what decent PC costs nowadays
If you for example look up any of eggwick's iron tournaments, or some "1 radiant vs 4 iron" videos or anything like that, you'll find that irons very frequently crash, have insane ping or have very low fps. This doesn't happen nearly as much in higher ranks.

Sure, someone with an awful setup *can* become good, but try playing capped to 20fps while teleporting due to bad connection and a 3$ mouse that wont let you turn 90 degrees in less than a second

Edit: I just think you're vastly overestimating what "cheapest" means in gaming gear.
Shes not self reliant bc she cant do shit by herself. Reyna has NO util. Unlike every other character in the game there needs to be 1 enemy on the screen for reyna to have abilities. 

This makes her insanely powerful for smurfs, incredibly inconsistent for anyone playing in their rank, and ass in pro play. That isn’t ideal for any of those groups.

That is why reyna needs a rework, she can still be a solo Q character after one, but goddamn make her healthy for at least one of those 3 groups
so im not the only one that got caught in this random ban stray??? cool.
I used Brimstone when I was Silver 2 and ended up being Diamond 1. People don't usually pick smokers so I accepted it as my opportunity.
I’m quiting until it’s fixed
The issue is probably crosshair placement. Cuz if your crosshair is ready for the person that you will see - you can 90% of the time 1 shoot headshoot them. So basically tracking is only important when enemy will peek you in unexpected way or when you are not ready for them.
And if you miss your shoot - you can start bursting and strafing.

If you want to spray, do it only in close range or when enemies peek you instantly 1 by 1
Balancing was crazy some agents were ridiculously strong for a long time. Jett could updraft twice, raze had two nades, cyphers came could hold a gun, which was a bug but definitely exploited. There was more that’s just off the top of my head
Slow down the building and switching your pick axe at  antenna. Since I slowed down, I haven’t had a survivor not spawn since. Could merely be luck tho
Hey don't worry, you just need to keep playing. Getting out of iron needs a map sense and you can get it by playing more and more. Try spike rush and swiftplays. Don't hop into ranked after 30-60 minutes of aim practice. Practice aim after you're done playing. 
I've seen the guide myself and sadly I was gold already or I would have tried. I still follow the aim routines and it's really pretty good. I'm on the road to plat now, currently gold 2.
Good luck soldier. You can do it!

Especially with breeze back, viper is great right now!

Just ignore them. Especially easy in game chat. How did the opposing team find out you were a girl?
Yes omg this is exactly what I mean. I’ve never been so “unlucky” before. When I hit my peak I kept getting in the teams where they were comming and not trolling even if we were down like 2-10.
Your mouse knows your spraying
Imm3. In all honesty, not sure it was really worth the time I put in. The gap between low imm3 and radiant is mind blowing. After I understood that, I just stopped playing all together. I can’t play with friends, because I stomp the other team, and their imm/equivalent will stomp my teammates. It’s not fun playing anymore.
Yes they keep nerfing g it because the save the world people get higher power level than the br  people
for me it’s chamber, I use yellow enemy outlines and ISTG on certain maps like breeze, his head is non existent at distance.
wait till u see jett mfs sniping with their kunai from above the walls. jett and raze are easy to play with and very hard to master
I’m in. Will post on here if selected

Lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Toxicity begets toxicity, at the end of the day both should be banned :P
the shorty play was just inconsistent to do all the time but they kept doing it over and over. it’s definitely still a viable play in a specific situation but not really what you should default to which was what I conveyed to him.
Normally if I'm flashing at the start of round I wave the bird at whatever teammate is stood near me. That's enough for them to know not to push until I flash IMO but apparently not cause they immediately push
I always check them out, I follow them 90% of the time.
Pretty much unless they’re being toxic I’ll give them a follow, I even regularly watch a few of them
Lmao sounds like my kinda lobby(bronze)

I sometimes have the same loss streak but every time i realise it i either go play Team Deathmatch or i go into a unrated match and play a completely different Agent for me its Neon. I don’t know what Agent you play but you should consider doing that. It helps me a-lot.
If your night market doesn’t show up that’s usually a sign that you’re on the watch list for potential cheating and have accumulated too many reports against your account. Sorry dude.
I’m a founder and have no idea what vbuck missions are? Is it the defend your base ones that net 100 vbucks?
Absolutely. Everyone that tells you differently is Diamond+ and out of touch with what lower rank gameplay consists of. Smurfing is a massive issue and makes it really difficult to organically progress in this game

Much better pc? How many frames you got? Are they stable? It's your first shooter or you have more experience with fps games? How old are you? And do you have the basic knowledge like crosshair placement, game sense? What role do you play?
Looks good!  might fit well on Save the World (STW), but I think it's missing a few things:

1. Make sure to check if your teammates have blue glow.
2. Track how many survivors you or your teammates have rescued.
3. The fonts feel too cartoony.
4. The white background on the map doesn't look good; perhaps add a blurred background so you can see what's in front of you while looking at the map.
Over a year for the recon phantom
Happens to me too
Isn't it completely opposite to say "Don't play for win, but for fun" and then say you should FF if you don't win?

I don't disagree with the mentality, but I'd redirect it to "Don't play to win, play to improve." If you start to losing and your teammates are starting to give up. Don't play to win the game. Play to have your crosshair placement at the correct height in every fight. And count how many fights you did that. Or literally any other thing that you need to practice. Pick one and hitting as high as possible is your win that game. No need to FF or feel bad about shit teammates. Because you are progressing on your journey and get to enjoy it. And might even grab a few aces and bring your team moral back while you are at it. Enjoy the whole process. Not just the end goal.

What are you going to do about it?
I’m in Japan right now. I was hovering around diamond 1 back in the USA, now I’m ascendant 1 on Tokyo server. And that’s without comms so I don’t think Asian servers are better. Maybe I’ve just gotten better, but despite good aim I genuinely feel American servers play smarter and have better macro. More fakes, mind games, combo ults. Just my take.
Because it doesn't show a variety of important things.  


As far as I know KASV percentage isn't weighted in either, eventhough it's one of the most important stats imo.  
I could be wrong here, but I also think it matter \_when\_ you get kills, I believe you get more if you get a lot of first bloods for example. yet a 1v1 clutch barely gets you any.

Wraith not wrath
Thank god
I really like just having a knife and the value is pretty good considering how many skins you get even if they're not the greatest looking skins out there

Awesome! Keep it up and have fun!
Aimlabs is free
Literally pay to win
i do the first two rounds with the ghost, first as just the ghost and then i can do my abilities and the ghost and it works for me then on the 3rd i can afford what i want
This is not a bug. It's just by random chance, it's always been this way.
Because I’m a collector and hoarder of pixels, and I want to collect everything pink and purple in this game. This includes eventually hitting diamond for the buddy to add to my collection 🤡
Good skins over any battlepass, any day.
Are you high rn?
run and gun and bait demon i respect it
It is. People “ping abuse.” Common logic says bad ping should be worse regardless, but something about the way riot has handled ping has made it so people with mid-high ping (like 50-100ish) have the advantage against you if you hold angles. 

If you adjust and play different against people like that (jiggling angles a lot more/agressive peaking), they lose that advantage, but it shouldn’t be a tech for someone in the first place
I never said i want a new weapon, i was saying if yall think that something like that could happen
Imho there's almost no difference between iron, bronze or sometimes even silver players. Those players either have a better PC/peripherals/internet/settings or just spend more time at the game than lower ranks

Don't get me wrong, good PC or mouse won't make you a better player of course, but if you play with 20fps, on 1000 edpi and 100 ping, you're in a big disadvantage compared to other people

Some may also think that playing the game more makes you better, but without guidance or knowledge how and what to improve, the progress is almost insignificant
usually when i farm in 140-160 zones, i switch to private so i can get everything i can, usually on 4 atlas so it can farm everything until its a complete wasteland, i dont do it when players are around, especially veterans/pros, if they ask for help ill assist and help them cus vets/pros do not have the time to wait around and they will lose their patience and resort to griefing that 1 player/leecher for not helping and leaving the game
Disregarding pro play isn’t because of his flashes lmao.

He isn’t used in pro play because he has no movement like a Jett or Raze. Literally nothing to do with his flashes at all 😂
Fracture grew on me a bit, not breeze though
Get better idk
I came back after a while and I was so confused as to why my trips were so effective
Gun round when both teams have Vandal + Heavy Shields + All Utilities.
Eco round when they don't buy any gun or armour in order to buy next round.

Yes, where is the video proof?
That’s the venue the devs decided to use for it…
I never really liked ascent that much, but now that sunset is in the game I'm starting to appreciate it. I dislike sunset, it's boring and confusing, is that a me problem or does snyone else feel it too? The map is small but I just can't remember where to look, and it's way too fast to rotate on. If this is the new map style.. nah bro
Huh. Always thought it was one. thank you!
Yes
Phoenix seems to be a good agent a lot of people play when coming from csgo or cod. Duelist character that usually takes space and is first contact. he has two flashes that curve around corners, a molly and a wall of fire. easier transition of util and understanding of agents, roles and their kits. 

another pick that might be good for you is KAYO as his flashes might feel more natural as his flashes are grenades. Initiator Agent with two flashes, a molly and a throwable knife that gathers information and suppresses enemy agents from using abilities. 

for maps you could play swift play for fast games more often. or hop on to a custom with your friend and have them teach you. 

thats just my opinion but have fun and hope this helps a little bit with your journey in Valorant :))
I started wish spike rush , it’s kind of chaos and casual and you can learn maps . Then graduate to swift play cause that’s more like a normal game but still super casual , then If you’re feeling up to it eventually do unrated.
Is there a reason I'm being downvoted? This is all factually true
It’s been time bubba
Yes it does, happened to me
iron, anyone?
Same struggle here as a duelist main. Some days I struggle to take first picks/create space for the team, and on some others I body with all the impact kills I can find. I need to know how to be consistent especially in solo queue.
Hes definitely cheating. Out of nowhere his HS rate hits 50%. Ive seen high asc - immos not put up HS rates like that. Kill wise i have but there’s genuinely no way that hes legit
Nice try riot. 

Too bad that I will be buying this bundle regardless.
Only in CS I'm pretty sure.
how TF do I find a higher mmr player to play with? I'm ascendant 3 and have no immo friends in fact all my friends are plat and below

turn your fps to 30 then switch it to 60, 120 or144 then and tell us why it looks so much smoother
This primarily works with Cypher cages, because they last long enough for your team to stack up, but not so long that you have to wait for the smoke to drop. Brim smokes, which won't recharge and last quite a long time, are terrible to use and also defeat his only niche as the triple-smoke controller, which is part of why he always has a place in the Bind meta.
you cant drive vehicles in fortnite though 💀
Yeah but not Riot lmao.
Anecdotally I haven’t had better luck in older lobbies. I was just in a game w/ two 30+ guys and a girl they were immediately making crude sexual comments toward who I reaaallly suspect was underage. Talking to each other they both claimed to be in long term relationships too 💀. Plenty of great people on this game but soooo many weirdos across demographics.
I didn't really mean it like that. Though you do also make a good point.

It was more so the value you get for the 50 dollars just isn't enough imo.

Like you can get some pretty good and full games for 50 dollars (ik some are more) while this person only got a knife and a gun skin. It's crazy to me how valorant can just ask a full game's price for 2 skins
IIRC it's the fastest way to level. So if they're trying to get to lvl 20 to Smurf in rank, that could be it.
at this point, i will try hard every single one of my breeze games to make all these people keep crying

i have 40%wr on bind but you dont see me accusing bind of being a bad map, the maps arent the problem, its you people

unless youre playing absolutely perfectly, you want to give up when there is still improvements to be made, mechanically and game-sense wise, valorant players seriously got the weakest mental ever

spoiled rich kids would get absolutely DESTROYED by valorant players in a weakest mental competition
it is a really cheap mouse with terrible sensors, sometimes so bad it completely throws off my crosshair placement by making me look up or down
The alsume existed before the video, and it will exist forever everywhere no corner of the Internet shall ever escape the insanity
I did tried r6 but somehow it seemed super complex to me and learning everything now feels "too late" like the train came and went , so people sticking with the game already know their way plus have years of experience on it. I do not have this feeling on valorant.
yeah ive got 2 skins i regret buying. chronovoid vandal and prime axe
Yup. People don’t wanna admit it, but the reason they are hardstuck is just being bad. Acting like Smurfs or cheaters are the reason is just shifting the blame and will never achieve anything. There are the occasional ones but not too much where it keeps you hardstuck. It’s just skill issue.
I appreciate it thank you!
Cap. Spectre is garbage ares is mid
I did the same once. Brim, bind, team MVP. By 14-14 I had lost all hope in my team and it was my rank up game so I wasn't willing to risk it. I did get 1 rr from it tho lol.

Ngl, most situations draw feels like a win to me. Especially if I feel burnt out and unable to hit shots. Call me a coward, idc. I would rather save my rr than risk losing it coz me or my team started shitting the bed.
I dont know about where people bring the logic that somehow 1-15 is ok as long as u doing ur job.

The game is all about killing people and make sure the spike explode on time. If u going 1-15 that means u aren't doing anything. KDA is pretty much 80% of your impact in a game, if u cant kill people how are u expect to win. If you need tips to improve i can watch ur vods and give some advice based on my knowledge. Currently im im3 300RR, was radiant in Ep1 and took 3 years break just came back.

But what help me win a lot is that, you need to have a plan and ask everyone to follow the plan. Pick a good agent that suits each map if u playing controller or sentinel. Duelist can instant lock Jet, Reyna work on all maps. Try to have impact on most rounds, impact = actually contribute to a kill or aggressive to help your team. Try to unpredictable, for example, ascent A main when u defending:

If the jet going right a main to peek and prepare to dash back, tell him to play on the backwall and u play close to the wall and jiggle to help distract people so they will focus on you while jet can shoot them off-guard and dash back. If they dont peek a main then u can hide in hell, gen.... ONLY play retake when they have 8/9 ulti KJ (so he gonna take orb and ulti) or something like that, otherwise u need to fight for the site, 5v5 retake is harder than 3v3 retake.

Most people below Immortal dont have balls to push through smoke when defending, they all hiding behind smoke scare to die and they only know about basic smoke. Take ascent B main for example, 99% omen will smoke market and CT, then whenever u make noise they smoke b main + molly lane and u guys stuck letting the Jet who went in die alone. Try to be smarter and sometime ask omen to smoke market + near the lane, so the whole team can focus on Lane only and get free site.
I still have mine
They're divesting some of the service and companies they acquired and are laying off 16% of their workforce.

That's pretty heavy handed cost saving measure. Someone is about to have a fairly bad quarter or few.

It's made for smurfs. Another proof of rito loving smurfs.
It’s crazy too cause France aided us during the revolution and invented the guillotine, how they became so cringe is beyond me 😂
Hard disagree, you're going to be broke regardless if you lose the round. Pros are most likely to consistently hit headshots and yet in esports we see guardians only being bought on eco rounds. There's good reasons for that. It's a niche weapon.
Wait, 31st of this month?
Best of luck with that. What did you struggle most with during the ranking up?
It's good for you! A few points,

First, it forces you to have the correct posture, see here 
— https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CJW4qybPT8 

Second, when you are playing on a ridiculously high sens, you start relying on your wrists to make corrections/movements. This is incredibly bad for you! You'll give yourself a RSI in the long run.

Third, it gives you a buff! Being able to make precise movements with your dominant arm while coordinating with your eyes and non-dominant arm is surprisingly beneficial for increasing dexterity. Your perceptualmotor skills will improve thanks to this.

Fourth, please don't give yourself a RSI. It's not worth it.

If you're going, OK, I want to give this a shot, then I have a suggestion on what worked for me.

I've found that because I totally lack upper body strength (it's so hard to build muscle!) getting a lightweight mouse that's ergonomic helped A LOT! And made it easier for me to perform quick, precise large arm movements. After studying a lot of people's lists etc, I settled on this one, https://www.gloriousgaming.com/products/model-i-2-wireless

I combined the mouse with a low friction mousepad and it was gucci, I found my mousepad via this google sheet, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RAnmZxDNduaGV8kB-GCvZ0MO6d9-0j9jmrU2f8dp0Ww/edit#gid=0

After setting it up, I then did the correct posture, some aim training to get used to moving the mouse and it helped A TON.

I now play at 0.322 and 700 DPI. Don't ask me why those numbers, they just work for me.
Mute AND *report* them. What else do you want? They agree to ToS which forbids toxicity already. 

What do you want, honestly? For player to take a course on inclusivity before playing their first match?
I don't even play valorant, why am I here?
Yo so what do u think about the other statistic in the picture, or are you blind?
As an older player with a discord friend your age who went through something similar, I thought your last sentence was kind of beautiful haha and helped me empathize more with him. 

I'd always just think ah, he's young he'd get over it(I mean you will eventually of course) but I forget a year or two is still really long(for you guys especially) even if it still goes by extremely fast. 

It must be like when a song reminds you of someone and gives you nostalgia except it's an entire generational game. Crazy.

Thanks for the perspective!
Why not let them pick things up if they aren't used yet? Genuinely wondering the reasoning behind this, I just started a couple months ago so they sound like good ideas to me atm.
who cares what they do with their money?
Alright fair enough
what do u mean? u think chamber the chamber nerf was due to players “abusing” the agent?! like you don’t think it’s riot and the devs, but the players fault for how chamber ended up in the meta. “get it nerfed” is just a crazy thing to say.

if there is potential in an agent to be “abused” then that agent should be. that’s the whole point of competitive 5v5 is pushing skill ceiling to the absolute maximum.
Because people instalock reyna too much to instead pick an agent that's more beneficial to the team. As for yoru, he's just and hard agent to utilize and they get discouraged when other people shit talk them for trying to learn a new agent
I can't even open tracker without 100% of my cpu being ate by overwolf
It’s happening it’s happening guys don’t panic
Nah, the bad idea would be to dodge when you have between 1 and 3 rr. When you are already at 0 rr, there is no difference between deranking right away and not deranking. If you win your next game you climb up (and "steal" a few points if you win less than 13), if you lose you would have deranked anyway and if you tie you could even steal 10 points.

Yeah I dont sit in corners in TDM, if you do tell me whats fun about it.
Tenz’s aim is pretty nuts his team play within pro league tho is def not the best but his raw aim is disgusting
You’re doing half of the comment. Spend 10 mins on YouTube looking up wrist stretches and do some before you game.
Yes i repeat it so much, this is the way..
You can detect it with AI if the user does exceptionally well and it’s out of range of x top players.  Doesn’t work good if you sneak it in to just slide under radar.

People in this sub say the gun play is the same but they’re clueless
>So the new agents also help counter the dominantions of some/the boredom that can come from using the same all the time? It's cool to see they try to bring lore with new ones, that I suppose make sense in the lore of the entire game?

Yep, you nailed it. Riot's 4 most recent agents have all attempted to explore a sub-class of their role and create more options for teams and casual players to experiment with. There are still a few agents who just always dominate because they are fundamentally strong/unique, but it's been fun to see professional teams try out new wacky compositions on the big stage with new agents.

The lore is not *that* fleshed out but they do try to connect characters/maps together and give them voicelines/interactions. Which is always a cool thing when your character talks to your friend's character, or they're canonically supposed to be good friends. 

>What makes certain agents good and other not in your opinion? Last night I watched a match from the french league, and I've seen a lot of viewers hating on Reyna, is it too precise of a question to ask, why they all seem to collectively hate that one agent (even my girlfriend expressed a sort of disdain towards that specific one)?

Reyna is a very selfish agent. In Ranked she is often seen as the smurf's choice or a pubstomper, because she can easily pick up 2-3 kills as long as she is mechanically superior to the enemies. However, if she cannot hit her shots, she is borderline useless. People's perception of Reyna is usually that when she is on your team, she is not helping anyone, and when she is on the enemy team, she is smurfing/boosting.

In pro play, she is rarely used because she has almost no utility to help her teammates. "Dive duelists" like Jett and Raze, and to a lesser extent, Yoru and Neon are much more preferred to Reyna because they can throw themselves into the site and create space. Their utility, which includes flashes, smokes, grenades, and walls, helps their own teammates scale up and clear corners. Meanwhile, Reyna has no base movement abilities and needs a kill to use her main utility, which only helps her and not her teammates. Therefore she is lackluster in professional play and rarely sees use.

The problem with changing/tweaking Reyna is the polarity of her strength in casual play and her strength in pro play. If you make her stronger for the professional scene, the casual gamers will suffer. If you weaken her for the casual players, the professionals will *never* pick her. This disparity is why she is hated—she can never find her place on any team or in any situation.
It's a hero shooter. You're never gonna find balance in any level of play. CS2 is the game for you if you want guaranteed balance. Maps will always have to be changed whenever new agents enter the game and current agents will always have to be tweaked for up and coming maps and agents. It can be refreshing as there's always something new to learn and master with each major update, but detrimental to others knowing that their preferred style of play may lose relevancy or completely cease to exist overtime. The only outcome I can see where balance is possible is if Riot permanently stops the production of any new agents to focus on everything that already exists, but then that'll just add on to the content drought.

I’m well aware.  The problem was not being able to see the contents of the llamas though.  Now there is absolutely no way for them to make money from STW directly though, that was what I was arguing.  If they had ANY way for players to spend vbucks in STW, it would be more profitable than it currently is and maybe they’d actually care about updates.

What is your ping like? If you are seeing 5 vandal bullets connect with your opponent and you’re not getting the kill, its probably an internet issue
The gia quest to feed animals can't be progressed since the update. The animals' behavior is weird, and they ignore food thrown at them.
I agree, the Dev team has incredible map designers
Skins are purely personal preference. Buy them if you like them, skip them if you don't.

An amazing deal on something you don't want is still a waste of money.
I think it’s more of it’s not actively costing them money, if people got together and went “we are only going to buy the battle pass this act and that’s fucking it” and they saw the numbers decline by a significant amount we would probably get weekly updates and get told the amount of manhours they are putting into development for it lano
Your not radiant lil bro
Bruh
okay i thought so. Thanks! 😊
Playing against smurfs is the perfect opportunity to vod review and see what you’re doing wrong, whether it be gunfights or decision making. Yeah it’s a loss but try to change your mindset and use it as a learning moment, you’ll go much farther much faster. I am in ascendant and still get smurfed on by radiants, albeit more rare, but it still happens
No you're not wrong for pointing it out, but you're no better because you would engage in the same thing for money. I pointed that out because I find that duality interesting. 

>If I worked at Amazon would you say I supported the treatment of their employees? I don’t think you would.

Yes, I would. Working for any organization is supporting it, unless you're a slave or something similar.
This happens to me on sage in unrated. Where it doesn’t matter 🙃. There’s always that one toxic teammate or even a duo that make it their life’s mission to make your game experience HELL. Skye it’s not as bad for me but sage it is insufferable , I’m trying to learn these characters to eventually play ranked so trust me this is just an unlucky spin of teammates not really an ELO problem. Again, happens in unrated on a daily basis
not the only reason. i go on silver accounts to play with my low elo friends 🤷‍♀️
same, 2-3 and went from asc1 to plat 3
[removed]
....you're literally not talking about aim; you're talking about mechanics and overall gun fights. If you know you should tap tap burst in your fights, can strafe and time your shots correctly because you've practiced that in the range and deathmatch, but you're still missing your shots...you have an aim problem. Breaking down the overall issue into the different smaller issues that make it up lets you isolate and improve those specific things before bringing them back together and doing it all in one motion. Beyond that, if you can't execute with no pressure in the range or aim training, then you're never going to do it under pressure of deathmatch or comp.
the brand is epomaker
That’s a very stereotypical statement the us who are the main people that use that joke are 7.5 times more likely to be stabbed in their own countries
Yeah I got a lot to learn. I got maybe 4-5 hours game time total. lol. I’m usually quick to pick up shooters and play very well but the mechanics of this one is something different. My brother picked it up way quicker than I did.
So again, what’s your response to the answer to your question, which is that banning toxicity in chat is more easily enforceable than banning smurfs, and that cheaters are almost non existent compared to other games
respectfully, if you’re hard stuck gold, it’s your game sense. when i point out the stuff my sister does wrong, she still doesn’t get it or see why her play was not optimal. if you’re losing your duels it’s bc you’re not taking advantageous fights or able to recognize when to peek/not peek which is also game sense.
Those are for getting XP on Creative

you probably already got all the reward cosmetics for this Fortnitemares, so who really gives a dang?

you're also in the Save the World subreddit, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR
Everybody whiffs. It doesn’t mean they shouldn’t get the gun back. What agent were you playing? If you weren’t playing a duelist then there’s no reason to keep it and not give it back. 

Btw, I didn’t read your post, I just read the question you asked because that’s all I cared about. I’m imm1 rn and imm3 298 peak btw and if you were to do that in my rank you would get put on blast lmao. Especially if you weren’t playing duelist 💀
Everyone drops up to 5 ranks after reset. You should get more points for winning and less for losing til you get back to where you were
The long and short of it, player numbers. These types of users, they do get banned, but they do keep creating more and more alts. If you actually sat down and thought about it seriously, you would realize that most users have between three and eight alts, heavily inflating the community size, which is realistically extremely small.  If they had harsher standards, it would mean the user base would drop significantly and that would destroy a somewhat destroyed game.
if anyone had any spare ps5 codes, I would love to try Valorant for the first time!
It does help to have a friend with you, just in case!  Unbinding the scoreboard is such a good idea.  Thank you!!
That’s what you got out of all of that ? It’s really not that serious. Everyone has their preference, I just say MNK.
If I get the code invitation, I’ll definitely share the available shareable codes here.
oof thanks
So you picked an agent on a map you haven't played her before played a sentinels weaker half and then say she needs a rework.
In my experience as a NA player, Cali servers have been the least toxic as far. Oregon comes in a close second, and Georgia servers are ~alright~
Uninstalling the game.
I would say it depends on your location… if you’re in a zone where things are spread out a lot I’d do what the other guy recommended but if your in a city zone where things are crammed in tight… in my experience, I have better results runnin archaeolojess as main, fossil southie and clip and any other blast from the past related hero in support… with archaeolojess as ur main, you still get 33% more crafting mats from clip in support, but you can do seven consecutive punches before you need to wait like 3 seconds for another but with the other loadout u get 3 consecutive punches then ur standing around waiting to punch again but have a 100% chance at extra crafting mats. I only prefer clip in lead for this winter ventures zone….  Everywhere else I main archaeolojess for when I’m farming and the sheer volume of punches always resulted in much more materials for me, but again that’s when there’s like literally shit to farm everywhere  open spaces clip might produce better results but I always stick with arch Jess hope this helps!!
My theory was that the game is bugged rn and is calculating PC rank as console rank. Either that or level gap
CODE ME BOYS PLS.
Kj can be pretty good on defense though
Y’all be saying 32inch is too big lol I play on 32inch with 144hz and it’s the best decision I made switching from a 24 to a 32
team comp doesn't matter when your team and the enemy team's util usage sucks (which it does in plat and diamond). what matters way more is coordinating with your team to take space and trade each other
It's bad cus it doesn't handle smashers or lobbers which are the only big threats in 160s other than bad teammates.
I think the smoke route is being understated in this discussion.

Like fuck learning mollies, just throw smokes down in chokes when ur team is executing, and be a human kj turret on flank.  Even if u die that's info that there's a flanker.

Like the scenario I'm envisioning is a dude with like a medical condition fucking their fine motor skills.  Even with that, you could be less useless as long as u plop down smokes and hold flank and die.

Ok, but I'm still convinced that you said that, and it comes across as that too.
The players here were ascendant 1-3 previous act.

It's "technically a smurf" it's the same rank as my main, but I use it to practice/duo with people
Oh im not saying you can lol im wondering
I hate the map so much since I usually go triple negative which tilts me on other maps. Doesn't help that so far out of like 20 queues 10 have been breeze.
Op is a good weapon no matter the agent, you need escape agents for it only if you want to play it aggressively

This kind of post about having some overall philosophy on buff vs nerf for balancing in games is always so simplistic.

The Devs should have an ideal for how the game and agents should be played and make balancing decisions that get them closer to that ideal. Right now it seems like they want to reduce the impact of certain ults as well as specialise agents that are kind of good at everything.

Buffing yoru wouldn't change Jett being too hard to punish when she gets caught out or being too strong holding off angles.

O shi it’s “masonisoverated#idktb)
I mean it would only damage it if you edit too fast, and theres no need to edit that fast unless like a smasher is coming to the base.
10 win streaks only to be followed by a 8 loss streak somehow…
Ohh yeah makes sense ty! I’ll also try both the guns out in dm :) thanks!
Just so you can have an ideia, you have 448 edpi (1600dpi\*0,28sens) and I have 280 edpi (800dpi\*0,35sens), I feel like a medium sens would be between something like 220 to 320 edpi, but you don't have to worry that much with sensitivity, there are pros with less than 150 edpi and with more than 400.
No you're right. It's contradictory.
I will sleep shortly after this message (Europe time)
29 here, silver 2 peak. I would gladly pay a sub for a over 21 queue lol
Listen if they can calculate it and we get the same vbucks I’m alright with it but I don’t think that will be the case

Unless someone wants to do the math and prove me wrong then I will be very happy
okay 👍🏽
Dude, that's just how it goes sometimes. Valorant gods giveth and they taketh away. Maybe take a break from the game for a bit and come back with fresh eyes. Or switch up your sensitivity again, who knows? Just keep grinding and you'll get back to demon1 status eventually.
if it makes a sound that others can hear you will see a bubble on your mini map centered around you
Use your native res with the best refresh rate possible. You're not a pro and you're probably not playing against pros. I'm on 1440p, everything is sharp and clear and heads are big enough.
You got it man! Focus on your gunplay and ONLY yourself. You will have bad games, but if you do some practice even just in the range, you will have a ton of improvement!
My Prime Vandal would like to answer in positive 🥂. It's my Fortnite sensitivity that's why so high, well in Fortnite also I have relatively higher sensitivity but I guess that's how I roll

Take your own advice lmao...
NO, ITS TOO LATE I AM GOING FORGET HOW TO SPELL AND WRITE IDK INSTEAD OF i don't know
Yoru (not at all if you don't have the gamesense which in lower ranks you typically don't).

1. Duelist - If you have good raw aim then Jett/Reyna/Iso. Otherwise Phoenix and Neon.

2. Initiator - Gekko/Fade depending on the your preference.

3. Sentinel - Cypher/Killjoy for guaranteed flank watch.
You 1000% have a chance because your level doesn’t reset. As for competitive quests we don’t have any as this is a PvE game. Maybe your looking for r/fortnitebr
I have played on both ranks this season,  and I have 3k hours on csgo over the past 8 years, I'm not new to any of the game mechanics you mentioned so I can definitely differentiate what kind of player I am dealing with. That being said, in platinum I have never seen more than 2 or 3 other players in the lobby have a substantially better grasp on the game then they did in silver. Maybe it's just an NA West thing but I can assure you it is just as bad. I have initiators who do not use their util, teammates who just want to 5 man deathball into site 80% of the time (I wish I was exaggerating) and no one concerns themselves with setting up for post plant never mind a simple crossfire or trade positioning when taking space. The level of mechanics definitely goes up but the strategical element does not go up much. Playing ranked in this game is extremely frustrating for me for those reasons, the only time I have fun in the game is when playing premier with some ascendent/immo buddies and going up against players of the same level as that level of play is what I'm used to in csgo.
I play in the mornings EST and switched to euro server. It's night and day compared to NA East.  At least 1, if not the whole team, helping build every match.
fentis passive is healing from his own flames, and viper's is not choking on her own fumes, I think those are all the ones that have a passive

The worst part is rising fans haven't even played the game. They just know the memes
Fuck using utility, that’s why you check the corners yourself. It’s not difficult.
You are preaching paragraphs to the wrong person, they aren’t disagreeing with you. They are just simply stating it SEEMS more justified to other people because of the persona he puts on
As someone else said, OP buy on defense is freelo because people don't have the discipline to contest it properly and just dry peek. It doesn't matter who you're playing, although obviously some agents have better tools than others. As for when, generally on defense when you have the eco for it.
your edpi should never be above ~375.
Tier 3 walls? The only smasher i ever “worry” about is mini boss in ventures. In twine its PD time. Above 108 i carry one to save time especially on smasher “waves” 

Below the xenon with affliction and bonus freeze damage is good enough with out but i am about efficiency

If you're on the phone like what why even join a game to begin with, and if it happened after you joined why not just say "hey sorry I need to go, something important came up" and leave?

Lol, the only reason I don't do that is because I don't wanna get reported or anything. I need to see if there are any YouTube videos of people trolling traders cause I'd ***L O V E*** to watch that.
U don’t have duelist? Or initiators in ur team? So just smoke and go in, no utilities flashes nor flush players out of different positions with mollies, no nothing. Your new to the game I asume, so I won’t be too harsh with you. But Brim should not being going in first, bc he has no utility for duels, sure his steam gives you faster fire rate and movement, but fuck even a stunt is better than that.

If I'm holding an angle, I'm always in ADS aiming at head level with these guns. Ares because you need the damage, and Odin because the aim punch can prevent you getting 1 tapped. If I'm swinging, I'll aim at roughly neck height because there's so much kick. Ares is terrible at swinging though

I’m not sure how the shorty is perceived on this sub. But shorty, $200 bucks and you can 1-2 shot full armor. 

Granted you have to get a little close but play the right angle and you get so much value!!

Huh, that’s a good way of looking at it tbh. 

Sometimes I forget I’m the weird one that only grinds competitive.

But you’re totally right in that aspect of the game. Valorant is a pretty sick game.
thank you:)
I’ve been playing overwatch for a while (on mouse n keyboard) do u think it’s similar?
Yeah, agreed. Actually, I think switching monitor size helped much more than the refresh rate. I used to play on a 14" laptop screen, now I play on a 24" monitor.
He definitely wants the Iso to be in the enemy team, so he can abuse it and win more.
From what you said, it seems like you’re just in low ranks. Because basically the only value Neon can provide is entry on T, and, maybe, a fast rotator on CT, without any other abilities to really help the team. If the enemy team knows what to do to counter her, it’s really hard to provide value as Neon.
I think getting a feel for it on new maps is definitely good and playing with audio will and can help newer players but for instance on breeze. If someone sits a window solely playing off audio of atk spawn or the walk way vs taking gun fights is when it gets annoying. So I get both your logic and the person you’re replying to as both are correct. Also I don’t get why you got downvoted not like your wrong in any sense.

Pretty unlike we are on the same game but honestly same it felt good too see people setting traps and not half floors it was 160 RTD.
If you just call it all dive then theres no point having the term. The whole point is it specifically refers to characters that can  very quickly move past chokepoints through movement abilities and thus create space for their team.
They do tho have you been in my lobbies, also I only use a and d to peek, I take advantage of angle advantage, but they're all just flashy tenzes it's crazy
Do you like flashing someone and killing them immediately or flashing someone and letting your teammate kill them? Also, you can go into the range and try out every character first before you unlock them
I have no personal beef with anybody and I'm not 1 for toxicity or shaming so no I won't. it's more valorant to blame then the creators but It takes 10 seconds on youtube to figure out exactly who I'm talking about. I'm sorry I'm not the average valorant player who just wants to throw hands with anybody that breathes
Cypher gets one extra wire and cage
If you're not a smokes 1 trick, you will be missing out on value when you play the role. Throwing the right smokes at the right times is not something you can just pick up in 1 or 2 games, it takes hours upon hours to build up a sense for it. Because of this, your smokes were probably off in a lot of scenarios. Obviously that Reyna is an idiot, you can just ignore/mute those people. If you want to keep playing smokes, make sure you have a thought process behind every smoke you throw. That way, you can look back after the fact and see whether you were thinking about the game the right way and whether that smoke was the most optimal.
No comms pregame? I’m out I’m sure someone would love to play silently while you have nasty wild discord ESex but not me

Tap/burst fire. The recoil goes up very fast so you either have to account by aiming down and crouchspraying (not gud) or you reset the recoil by tap/burst firing.

Breeze is, for some reason, the only map I perform on. 

I also think that it is, or at least used to be, the best map to watch in pro play. I will even dare say that the Chamber meta was perfect for Breeze.

I like it, not super love it. But I am good at it. As "good" as my silver ass can be, anyways.
Jett's smokes for sure. Can you 1 way a defuser on gen without peeking? If not, theres some growth there.


Generally, all of em. Even brim smokes, if you can do the good one at bind with the one way in spawn, you can always do it faster. The faster you do it, the less likely you get caught out and can push with your team on the fly.
The Sova drone does 75 damage when tagging enemies and 30 heal when tagging allies
What's crazy is none of these guys have bigger mousepads than other players. They all basically use the same size. Idk how they do it because my sens is slow and I feel like I need my bigger one lol (xxxl saturn pro). But they're likely 10x better at picking their mouse up and readjusting quickly.
I also have an alt account but for when my internet is fairly inconsistent. Not enough to where it’s unplayable but enough that can cause me to lose a gunfight here and there. I’ve only barely eeked into diamond and my alt is gold 2 so it’s all relatively the same rank for the most part since gold has been where I’ve seen most of the smurfs but it’s also where the majority of the elo I’ve been in
I don’t learn anything from a level 21 Jett dropping 30 kills against my team when they just w key and out aim everyone.

Sentinel - KJ, or if my team wants a second duelist then Phoenix, never played initiators and can play smokes at a basic level

Phoenix is obviously the most fun, I just play hella braindead with him and just run inside with flashes
Shield husks are part of the reason xenon bows are so widely used, fuck them shields.
Y'all clown on these updates for not adding content, but that's why I like this game. I went through 100 major updates in CoD: Warzone, and 90% of them either worsened the game or added meaningless bloat, often both.
just quit bro, it aint worth it this game is dogshit. its all about if you can manupilate running and gunning, and if you have higher ping, sometimes using that as an advantage to wide swing ... just quit bro save ur self

At least make it believable. At 12-12, one side only need 2 wins to win the game.
Yeah hell yeah that’s the way you gotta do it
Learn to strafe back and forth so you're not just standing still. You still want to stop when you shoot, but you shouldn't be stationary for so long. Makes you an easy target.
Usually when they say bad in twine they mean end of twine, 140-160. Remarks are usually only works up to 124 which is true, afterwards it falls off drastically.
Depends on your monitor if you have a 165 hz monitor you arent getting true 700 fps, the max is going to be 165. Your fps isnt capped so thats why its so high
vortnite
dopai is another one imo that doesn’t get as much recognition as he should. sure, hooj is better but dopai shouldn’t be overlooked.
Imo lower stable fps is better than a stuttering high fps. But in some cases the input delay isn't worth it to use vsync to help stabilize frametimes
Not the worst thing, but something I have noticed, is that as a diamond 2 peak, I'm now in g3. Players here are more mechanically sound than they were a year ago when I was in diamond. For reference, I played tdm, unrated, dm, basically anything but ranked after I graduated college and didn't play cval anymore. Recently started playing ranked again, and while I'm not as good as I used to be, the players here are much better than they used to be. This is something I would probably call the Woohoojin Effect. His rise in popularity and helpful guides have helped so many players. It's great to see, but at the same time I just can't keep up anymore. 

Recently, in my death matches, I will be getting domed by bronze and silver players. Just mechanically sound players still in the lower ranks. Not that there weren't some mechanically good players before in these ranks, but now it seems to be more common than it used to be.

It's not a bad thing. Player base is getting better, but I hate that the work I put in so long ago just doesn't matter so much anymore. Going from gold to diamond in one act and having ascendant mmr, now back in gold, struggling against players who have the time to put in to their craft.

Proud of them, but hate it for myself

I'll never forget my D3 to Immortal game. 

I got blessed with the best team I've ever had. And I don't even mean skill wise. 

When we loaded up, I said "alright boys this is my immortal rank up. Let's beat some ass."

From that moment on everyone communicated every single thing, never raged or fought. Every single round or big play was hyped up by everyone. 

I ended it 28-3 as KJ. We won 13-0.

In the final round I got a 3k and put the team into a 4v2. Everyone started congratulating me and telling me they got this W. 

Added all of them and we never spoke again. As it was intended.
April fools 🎉

I literally just played a game where I did my usual greeting, someone greeted me back and then another person asked us to suck their balls outta nowhere. The first round was these two characters insulting each other over comms.


They calmed down. We won 13-0. I hate this game.
Tbh mostly agree except when there's big physical conditions you can notice - things like super delayed reaction, jittery af aim - to the extent you don't feel you can fix the next game. Yea those days are probably not for competitive.

I know her best as Keg. She’s a wonderful voice actress.
Mainly Punz because he isn’t over the top and genuinely is playing the game. Kyedae, she’s really funny and has a really cute personality, along with TenZ since he’s pretty grounded as well. Woohoojin is also pretty entertaining but I mainly watch his vods since I don’t catch him live that much
    What issue happened? When joining other or them joining me, i get major lag and even if i can finish the game without timing out i have to reset my internet to get it to go away.
    
    What platform are you playing on? PS5 and PC
    
    What happened prior to seeing the issue? weekly update is the only real thing i know has happened.
    
    Do you have a link to video/screenshots depicting the issue? none
Need them for the bassassin quests
i think sugarfree in ow is black
Lmao the bullet turned into hotdog then into a butterfly. Anyway nice try. Keep practicing. Still a long way to go.
What if you’re doing bad? Do you initiate a surrender then? That’d be pretty hypocritical.
controller seems so boring to play at first but if you put the hours in you will realize how every decision u take will make or break the round. especially if you're an IGLing controller
And you also don’t loose as much RR when you don’t perform as well lol
and I'm tired of seeing Jett and Reyna every game. it doesn't matter dawg
Depends on the map. Viper is still a lot better on icebox and breeze
Unslotting a common weapon shouldn't use flux
trigger them into wasting their magazine, when they reload, push them. You can flash them or smoke them off to surprise them from the side. Alternatively I like playing op against them
Same on TX and Cali servers.  Ours and the enemy team’s teammates dc’d one by one. Think it’s to do with the new act.
How?
nope, congratulations first you gave a horrible take then you made a wrong assumption
Breach, since he gives you zero information and his flash is the easiest to dodge.

Hey! So whenever I play valorant, I only use my wired Logitech 502. I haven’t been able to play with my wireless gpro super light wireless mouse, as i can’t get use to it. Maybe I have to play more Valorant with the wireless? Tbh, I haven’t touched Val in a few months… but my go-to mouse would be the wired 502 for sure.
His entire kit is very valuable and presents a lot of opportunities for coordinated util domination
Generally a sheriff. Always reliable.

Depending on map/agent/enemy habits/credits I'll change it up though. Usually a stinger/bucky/judge/shorty/Marshall depending on the above situations
Yes ikr
I don’t / it is the prevalent usage among human population - 10000000 or so idiots do.
You have no idea what you're talking about...  Mainly because 

1. Tencent isn't owned nor managed by BlackRock.
2. Blackrock doesn't own jack shit. They're an asset management company, they buy and sell stocks for other people to make them money. 
3. Blackrock isn't some big Kabal like some twitter nuts would make you believe.
Founders will stay founders we founded this game
Cypher 1 trick to immortal.

One thing I love about Cypher is being permanently allowed to lurk anytime. The freedom you have with lurking is amazing and the tools to do so is absolutely insane. Camera in one spot, trip on your blind spot, do the cheesiest things that works even on the best players. The fact that he can bail himself out with a cage. I can go on. Coming from CS and being lurk there, he’s like made for me. 

I hate that he’s getting more play and Raze. Fuck Raze man
I def trolled in this vid
***WE DID IT! WE BEAT THE STORM***
Do I love answering my own questions? yes I do.  


For real though, the graphics mainly changed bc of UE5 and they Didn't really bring a lot of old features with it. The thing I miss the most is trees blowing in the wind. I barely even played back then compared to how much I do now, but still. It just felt so much more... detailed.
I agree, the orb will be hit better and better and better. I see Iso being a very nice choice for high fire rate guns who will simply direct their fire after a kill in the general direction of the orb and good to go. 

His ult as well, as you said, on equal skill level Iso will almost always get the pick and the best part is taking an enemy out of the fight, too. either temporary or set. It is a great ult as it is.  
If you would, as OP wants, make him more advantageous, the ult will become unfair. Every ult in this game has a counter. Iso's counter is superior gunplay of the enemy. No ult is guaranteed great, everywhere is a weakness, on purpose, otherwise it would simply be broken and unfair.
500hour playtime peaked asc 2, asc 1 rn
I used to be an entry controller in silver because my teammates refused to enter site
Your KAST last season was 66%, which is absolutely horrible, especially for iron.  Play with your team more and stop baiting.  Also having a 9% HS in iron is inexcusable lol
Clove and maybe sova but fade???? That’s wild lol

This is amazing, Fade is one of my favorite characters! I hope you make more because this is just phenomenal tbh.
The firing sound sounds odd to me, but the little riff when you get a kill is like none other
Gekko. Always Gekko.
Prelude, I feel I play so good with it. Very strange
What type of games do you like? There are SO many games out there that can change your world.

Tho 1 taps are nice
Keep spamming smoke button before respawn and it'll happen
Thanks for the heads up, I totally will 😊

And no I don't have the fondant pieces pre-made, they do have to be started like 2-3 days ahead of time just so they are firm enough to place but for the most part everything is made to order/from scratch 😊

1663 hours and 1480 of that is in comp lmao
Lol from 3h to 125
no
1. no one plays unrated lets be honest lol. Should they when learning a new agent? Sure yeah, but that's just wishful thinking. 
2. That's my whole point, you don't "**have to** play something else", you can easily win with 5 duelists or any other combination of agents. Is it easier when you have a proper comp? Sure. But it's better to have people on agents they know than have a proper comp. 
3. very high percentage is still being a little over the top, but maybe it's just different in your mmr bracket. Thats not so much of an issue of instalocks though. More like people just being bad in general and not understanding the game well enough imo.

I'm right around your rank (D3 50) and I can't say I've experienced this before. A friend of mine actively IGL's every chance he gets and over the course of ~200 games we've only really met resistance like 5 times. You're either blowing things out of proportion or just not great at communicating. 

For me I IGL sometimes when my friend isn't there, but usually I'll just let people play their own games. If I'm seeing a pattern, or we're losing rounds, that's when I pick up the reins and suggest a play. I'll mention the ults, the buy, and a general game plan but nothing strict. What you're doing is probably just too much. Micromanaging or backseating or something of the sort. I will also tend to say a lot of things that don't pertain to the game, or hype up a guy like crazy if he just popped off. Maybe add in a few compliments, some pleasantries.

 Ultimately we're all here to improve and have fun, and if a game isn't fun then it's not a game. Don't be so uppity and relax on the IGL'ing. It's annoying to have someone constantly in your ear overcomming. Don't be that guy. Also I feel like you're probably overreacting to small mistakes, if people are getting toxic so quickly. It's just a misplay, allg, nt, next round. If you lose, gg go next. 

tl;dr drop the ego and chill out on igl'ing
Since it's in the same genre as CS, its core mechanics are very similar. Some differences are that there aren't really set spray patterns, the first 6-7 bullets of the Vandal are always the same, after that it has a certain amount of vertical recoil per bullet and randomized horizontal recoil. Counter strafing (tapping the opposite movement key to stop faster) isn't a think in Valorant since you decelerate much quicker than in CS. Despite that, the top running speed is actually a bit slower.

With those in mind, spraying is less prevalent in Val, usually reserved for 0 to 10ish meters. Full explanation of proper technique can be found in Woohoojin's Gunfight Hygiene video. His channel in general is a treasure trove of info.
yeah im aware, i guess i just find it crazy how people struggle with smokes, it seems so intuitive once you play the game enough, like i could play smokes if i really wanted to but i dont because i find it boring
2 times range strafing bots 50x
1 death match 

And that's it I don't have much time to waste diamond 3
People are people. Just tell them you'll make them the best plate of lasagna they've ever tasted after you win and they'll be either left speechless or crave food and get fat if all they do is play Valorant all day. Win/win.
No aim training (I did some a long long time ago, but only like 3-4 hours) and currently Gold 1, pretty sure I deserve to be here, some games I cant hit anything and others im tapping heads. Need much more consistency between games to actually rank up
Nerf? Id say shes not far from buff territory
Just get better comms aren’t the only thing holding you back
In a room of 100 people, there are only 15 players diamond+. It’s a bit ridiculous to claim that diamond sucks. All skill perception is relative, but for the majority of the community dia/asc is hard to attain.
That’s literally on topic on topic asking u to b more clear in ur wording. Mf tryna call me pathetic but typed “xDD” bro I can’t haha
Oh dear god you’re right. God bless our ears for those voice lines… let alone when they have convos with each other in game 😂

The "unbind crouch" thingy is more of a low(est) elo tip to improve mechanics and reduce panic. It sounds like your confusion stems from watching content you've already surpassed
Yooooo the new prices of things are way too inflated but if you like it then I don't blame you :)
Oh no this almost never happens. It's not everyday that you get Odin spammed like that. Few and far between. 1v1s for odins are super easy to counter and even 2 at a time with a decent jiggle peak.
Deleted? No. Reworked? Probably. Her and chamber have similar problems, being characters with basically nothing that can help the team and built-in Get Out Of Jail Free cards.

IMO you can make her dismiss more like Jett's dash or Iso's double tap, needing to be primed, recharging on double kills, and has 1 free use ever round. It partially gets rid of her gimmicky nature and gives her utility no other agent has, like peek angles or take space while intangible, or dodging utility on command, given enough foresight.
Yeah but you're missing the overall point. Double Tap patch 8.11, was overpowered, and made Iso relatively good for soloQ even *if* you were literally just using it. I didn't have to use anything besides it and I still managed to top frag quite easily.

Now that it's being brought down in line to other abilities, the rest of his kit needs to be looked at. Because the rest of it kind of fucking sucks ngl.
Smokes are any vision blockers that one can still walk through. Smokes as agents are all controllers. All smokes in game:
- Viper orb/wall
- Harbor wall/tide/orb?
- Jett cloudburst
- Brim smokes
- Omen smokes
- Cypher cage
- Astra smoke
You can put all of the Fortnite Pros vs 1 StW player using Neon Sniper Rifle, a weapon that literally gives you Wallhacks and Shoot-through walls. So good luck on fighting even 100 StW players.
I’d do the same for you brother
I think they should remove guns too. They are too overpowered. I die to them every round.
You definitely aren't good enough aim wise but the game is more than just raw aim.  It's good you play controller, you can provide a lot of utility and help without needing to frag out.  I'd say you are a bit higher than you'd be solo, but I also don't think you are "boosted".  If you figure out the aim portion you will be a demon.

Cool that's what the upvote button is for,  no?
new genders though no. At least ourside of twitter.
It takes me forever to even log in. I'm on ps5. So I'd imagine people are having the same issues and just don't have patience
I immediately bring out the Odin when I am against a deadlock.
Yeah, just kills more husks
Happy cake day! Absolutely not too old. I believe the average age of Val players is higher than you think it is.
Yup, I meant full ranks. Also I do get ascendents and immortals as a plat right now. I’m sure if someone who’s silver is as good as me mechanically then he’d also get Ascendents and Immortals in DMs
They do. But they will come back after the defense is over whether you win or lose. Basically, when you start a challenge, it saves your base.
Me too, it seems after a couple of report feedbacks i got they seemed to always be accepted, maybe its to shut me up but who knows.

Nah its alright! Unlike some ppl here, you come with good intent. Maybe i check out the map 👀

I don't know what to tell you man, having 1 ability with some outplay potential doesn't make a character interesting
Smokes aren't meant to pretect your entries from dying, it's to help cut off the amount of angles that need to be cleared when taking a sight.

I would say Breach is quite strong right now and doesn't need more buffs.

In the Initiator class, I think it's like this

* Overtuned - Skye
* Strong - Breach
* Map-specific: Sova, Fade, Gekko
* Undertuned: Kay/O

Nerfing Skye and buffing KayO would probably be my personal selection for Initiator balancing.
Yes. It's placebo effect and it actually improves your aim
Can’t tell you too much without seeing your gameplay. If you have your VOD on YouTube to link up or something it would be cool
What am I seeing here basically?
Where did you hypocrite comment go? And what with the foul language. And is it not your responsibility to make me understand? 

I thought that was your very first argument when you started meddeling in the discussion I was having with someone else?
> I don’t want to do it anymore

Then don’t? Why is this even a reddit post
Why does it matter what brim is clearing?

Also why are our so obsessed with the footsteps when none o the footsteps are audible?
Well i have played 23hrs this act so…
yeah he just described CS but with a dash lol
round differential matters, also sometimes you get matched with better/higher mmr opponents and if you win you get more rr than usual if you lose you lose less rr than usual and vice versa when facing weaker/lower mmr opponents.
[removed]
Skins have no impact on the game? My Prime vandal would beg to differ.
How many times are we going to see this exact same post
I'm guessing all 40 of those reports were for voice chat right?

I always record my games, so if someone is blatantly being toxic and saying banned slurs then I just make a little recording and send it over to Riot.  Usually a couple days later I get the notification in game. 

But make sure you report both in game, and then send it to their site.  

Text chat reports should always work, its just an automated system.  Unless you are reporting someone for saying "ggez" or something.
Waaaait this exists now? I go now. Thanks
No, the way you play in both games is much different. 

If it was say, different sens between CS2 and Valorant. Then it'd be bad, because fundamentally the games are very similar and are direct competitors as a result.
Yeah you have Fortnite and Fortnite battle royale
Appreciate it, definitely will once I return in front of my pc

You are on the Save the world subrredit, it is the same Fortnite, but this is the base game which it's development got cut.

Anything related to Fortnite's spin off: Battle Royale and it's counterparts it's on the r/FortniteBR or r/FortniteCreative
Sounds like a good idea. I don't think solo queuing will ever be optimal but this will definitely make it more bareable

We can't even have a smart Replay System, why count on AI? Seriously Rito you are ignoring the fact that people have wanted this feature for 3 years.

11.
Pretty sure most was swift
gold 2 to silver 1, it was slow and painful.
>Graphics/art style.. I know that the game looks different from 5 years ago but it still looks like BR of 5 years ago to me, just brighter lighting. So what exactly caused this.

Caused what? The lighting was upgraded. The new lighting is caused by the fact that the lighting was upgraded.

>What’s going on and can’t Epic do anything about it? Why would Epic make lighting look like BR when there’s no logic (art style same)

There's nothing going on, it's just lighting. What would you suppose they would do about it? I don't follow you.

>Does Epic look at this sub?

They do. They no longer liaise, but the STW Team does receive reports about what's going on around here.
having the sameproblem since yesterday 11.10.23 the audio especially the soundeffects and the main sound are really fucked up, it's like just really silent while like a Game win sound in creative is absolutly busting my ears. No fix yet?
I always take the first week or two off.

In fact I haven't come back yet this season since the BP is unappealing to me and I really hate the new breeze.
Game without either Smurfs or boosters are rare
We ballin
I have bad internet apparently and the game runs like shit with it. So I quit to save my mental cuz it isn’t fun getting shit on by irons and new players due to internet diff. 

The games lag compensation makes it even worse. I won’t play again unless riot introduces the option to reset lag compensation in the settings.
You wall bang?
the truth is, not very good fam.

some people just take forever to improve. some of us arent gifted. take myself as an example.

3k hours is csgo. i placed silver in valorant.

I continued to play for 3 years to reach immortal.

Please understand that for some people, it's about getting better 0.1% every day.

Play the game you love. I kept playing because I genuinely enjoy clutching a round. I love that shit.
raze is like best agent in the game like now  
she's the most oppressive agent

satchel is too strong and versatile

if you compare to post nerf jett  
jett only have 1 updraft and dash, smoke is really short

raze kit is a lot stronger  
e is free and better than most molly, it can clear trap really well, recharge with 2 kill  
radius is too big it could tagged enemy and easily to kill them  
boombot is strong tools that give her info  
raze ult don't get use for econ like jett but it's more oppressive

she can jump entry like crazy while having strong nade and boombot in her kit
Bro it's a game, it's not your life , play it for reasons one plays a game . To have fun .. 

If you ain't having fun then quit and if you are , continue
I know, that player was popping BEARS left and right, while I was obviously doing a melee challenge to kill 300...

That guy kept spamming BEARS AND TURRETS at SPAWN, who spawn bears, gross.

Ohhh, wait, you're the Bear spammer, my bad, I was rooting for the golf club swinging player, not the spawn spammer.
Huh, might have to give it a try I guess
how do u back out cuz ur afraid of losing rr. u win it back sometime anyway. its so frustrating having people back out when ur like 15-15. time wasted. plus i dont think u lose a lot when its ot. or i have never anyway
I WANT FRACTURE BACK

I WANT MY STUPID NUTTY PLAYS BACK
Did you read what i said? Smurfing is already rampant. The games free it takes 0 extra effort to make a smurf account
So you’re the brim with no comms? 👀
>hit weak points

hit anything 5 times
Track them with your eyes. Read their movement pattern and either aim where you think they’re going to go and click as they pass over your crosshair, or if it’s a strafing gunfight, wait until the pause between strafes, then go for your shot. 

If you have access to an aim trainer, pasu scenarios on kovaaks are great. I’m sure there’s fantastic alternatives on aimlab aswell.
Iso’s domain expansion will never not be funny
dont do this they will ban you for cheating the rr system
Quite silly

Ventures ends June 17th i believe
Whenever I pop off, it gets messy.
Well they buffed Cypher, which is one of Neon's counters so that is a huge factor on why she is picked less as well. Other than that, jett and raze are just better at entering sites.
Unlucky.
My x Box says I need 25 digits, is one missing? 😅
I would love this since I could just watch the role I want. I think the problem is that Valorant does not have a spectator mode... goes hand in hand with the missing replay system

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 unluggy uce your fault for having unspent weapon superchargers
As a prelude to chaos ace diehard I would like for you to retract this statement if not I’ll send you my space balls to your address
I legit get slurs in half of my games, including those I was a great teammate, carried and even IGL - purely because of my last name. It’s frustrating, especially when u solo q, but that’s just eu servers. What do u do? Nothing. People are just dicks sometimes online. U just mute and move on focusing on having fun & impact on your game. Once the game’s over they’ll have to deal with whatever issues they have that make them act like this online - not u.
It's pretty hard if there elo is on the line. I'm pretty sure it's a non-problem. I've never necessarily felt the need for this feature. Though a few times I have thought I'd rather have the orb and the money then this guy on our team. People's Elo's are still on the line. I doubt it'd be abused often.
There is a noticeable difference in 144 -240. I have had both and when I go back to 144 anything other than micro flicks is very choppy compared to 240.
I run rifles in ranked (mainly the guardian), this is more for the casual gamemodes. I want to run smgs when I'm just trying to have fun
I dont mind dealing with them either, in a case my team isnt full of dumbasses that spray it with physical weapons just cause they wanna get the kill instad of me, like sorry for dealing with the shiny-cheeks over there lol
It's just hard when they're immo and we're gold/plat
Why do I feel like this is a meme post and OP doesn't have a gf and also drew the raze themself lmao
High risk high reward, u can totally stop a defuse or plant, and btw the radius of the ult is MASSIVE like actually MASSIVE, MUCH BIGGER THAN BRIM ULT for example
What’s the “normal” variant of the knife? The recon balisong?
viper is just a lineup andy for molly and debuff smoke.
Wow we already have lego and festival subs lmao
the judge did get nerfed in the past (a bit more than two years ago?). The range used to be even better.
I use AverageSean because  sova only and just so folks know there's double shocks incoming soon 😂
Putting some walls in front of the second level Broadsides and a Floor Launcher in front would not only trigger the second level Broadsides, but also allow the cannon balls to bounce downwards, potentially hitting more Husks below. It could work for the flatter section on the other sides of the defense, while leaving the area clear on the elevated land.
Plat 1 I peaked ascendent last act
oh okay make sense thanks for letting me know :)
the only reason I play comp is so I can play in my skill level
So that's the limit?
Which do you recommend as a good starting point? Also are a lot of the game modes fan made? And finally sorry, how do you play as other characters like Spider-Man or Optimus Prime or whoever
I mean if they ask once it’s fine.
It’s the fact they ask literally every single round lol.

Yes kills are all matters in game
We are missing the role you and him usually take. I mean to get lots of kills as Reyna and become match mvp is a whole lot different effort than to do it as any other agent who can’t heal himself and has to bring up a separate screen to access his utility. Riot has made an effort to reflect that in rank gain and loss.
will try this, thank you!
Lol I farmed metal a while ago. And I have multiple stacks of batteries every time someone asks about battery’s I feel dumbfounded. Like how the fuck do you not have batteries and in twine 🤡
Oh damn I didn't even realize this. I've been terrified of switching guns while camping and the enemy hearing me
just wow
Wait, am I (all of us) the author of this post?
Can't recall stars anymore and smokes last 10 seconds instead
I totally disagree with the first two points. Either by rotation or just pulling out of site, a team a defense could just play retake and leave site control for the time being. It doesn’t really change the fact that total site control isn’t a one-way ticket to victory if you plant in the open. Especially if you consider that in a 1v3 situation planting in the open instead of default could totally be worthless if you’re forced to defend the spike without any other means. I don’t really see any more benefits than securing a spot that’s as easily defendable and can give you an additional choice when defending the spike (the use of post-plant lineups). Remember, having legs one can defend the spike from multiple locations even when it is planted default.
As for the third point one could argue that since every point on site could be considered not open when you take relative position into consideration. 
Even planting in a the most open corner possible makes you completely vulnerable from at least one other point. That where positioning helps you. You could plant default and position yourself in a spot that makes the spike completely visible and in the open when relative to your position. But let’s not bring rhetoric into this, perspective or not, I understand what you mean for in the open. But again, it’s not as easy as you make it think.
Omen or phoneix
Really depends on the computer specs or internet too still, even is CS2. We did have someone that took like 1:30 on our team to load in. Not to say that there's nothing Riot can't do to try and fix it but it does happen with pc specs even in cs2.
[deleted]
Turns out I have been falsely banned.
He’s saying “I don’t understand this system” as in why are they using this bullshit system when I want something that’s more convenient for me. Use the fucking context clues in his post. He understands the method is to increase purchasing through FOMO he literally implies it in the title. He understands he’s just complaining and looking for validation. I guess I should only expect surface level responses in a surface level post on a surface level subreddit.
What context did you decide to use Blowjob in Valorant that was perfectly fine?
May I get one
You can always unmute for a round or two to see how it’s going, and then re-mute if the vibes are still meh. I don’t think teammates get any notification or indicator when you toggle those settings. 

Unfortunately, the impact negativity has on others varies so much. There’s no one size fits all to this so I’d just evaluate every once in a while what you personally think will have you and your team playing their best.
Don't use the guardian in ranked too, that's needing yourself. My advice as someone who reached ascendant starting from literal iron 1 is to train in Deathmatch/TDM focusing on one thing at a time. For example play a couple matches focusing only on cross hair placement, doesn't matter if you died doesn't matter if you spray, doesn't matter if your movement is incorrect, focus only on that. Then when you have that mechanism engraved and you don't have to focus anymore in order to have a decent cross hair placement train something else, like strafe shooting or your movement. Try to divide every mechanic on work on them singularly like you would do with any sport. A tennis player will practice each shot for hours maybe doing one hour of only forehands and the same goes for valorant, 2 DM of only burst, 2 DM of only one taps, 20 minutes of flick in the range, 20 minutes of cross hair placement practice in different maps.
STW needs a upgraded tutorial
I’ve been playing Valorant for 2 years and have only met with 1 cheater. And although there are very few cheaters there’s a ton of smurfing
With good crosshair placement and if you peak predictably, the enemy will be able to destroy you almost instantly if you keep doing the same thing. You have to switch up some stuff you do when you’re being destroyed, jiggle peak, jump peak or even try to jiggle and prefire the angle. Keep the enemy guessing to break their flow and to not let them predict you. A predictable player is a free kill for anyone who has good crosshair placement
so gaming the system... promoting the solo play for a game intended for cooperative.... that's laughably stupid
It uses your hidden MMR when unranked to determine if you can queue together, doesn't matter if you aren't ranked yet. That's not poor matchmaking if there is a clear skill difference between players in the party, quite literally the opposite.
That's not our problem? This is the stw subreddit. Try r/FortniteCreative for help. There is nothing we can do here.
correct play doesn't exist in this game, not even in pro play. in every split second and in every second you as a player will always have an opportunity to bait misplays and capitalize off them. immortal 2 btw
Hey royal, I think that you are justifying something that doesn’t need justification. You make a entire living off of this. **as someone who is comfortably radiant** I would Smurf 10+ hours a day if that was the best way for me to grow. Smurfing is bad, sure, but how much impact can you ACTUALLY have? The people who want to smurf are going to with OR without you, and you realistically aren’t holding anyone back more then any other of the Smurfs in the ocean. You are effectively +1 in a MASSIVE pool. It really doesn’t matter at the end of the day to me at least. If a player REALLY deserves a high rank, a few games with Smurfs won’t stop them.
It’s ok to lose. You’ll be ok.
Riot never dissapoints to fail
i agree with what you said but it would have been interesting if they buffed bucky and then made the judge 2900 without changing dmg
Not at the moment. For whatever reason, there is no separate setting for environment texture quality and player/weapon model quality like other games would have, just one global setting that controls both simultaneously. The engine Valorant is based on supports separate qualities for maps and weapons.
damn
I played STW since 2018. Only to ever see one.
I just hate the propane ones. SOOO MANYYYY
I like them and think they’re pretty good for a new agent! But the character design itself feels pretty chaotic and overwhelming, just a bit sad to not see more of a nod to Scottish heritage/culture, though I could be missing some hidden reference since I’m not Scottish myself.
Literally who? If this isnt save the world related you are looking for r/FortNiteBR sport
Health is restored, and negative status effects are removed if I'm not mistaken. That's to make the fight 60/40 in iso's favor.
If Fortnite started making more of the STW heroes available, like they have with Cloaked Star and a few others, people would probably get them. I'd love to have Dennis, the Director and a few others as playable skins for BR.
Naisu
I cant find it
Neo fucking frontier bro
Not enough time invested. When I play a lot, I notice consistency. Now I play maybe once a week with a few drinks.
Tell me I'm wrong. What's your rank?
Damn the guy came asking for fortnite questions and people want an update
if high elo means people who understand the game and play to win then he’s right? 

high elo = hard to win because people play the game correctly
RAHHHH THE GRIND NEVER STOPS
I played for like 3 days and most of my missions started as me hosting them, never had less than 4 players by the end of the mission(unless someone just quited, but that's about it), even in 46 zones
Appreciated! I am of course aware of the separate MMR and while I think the silver player in your example was just at the beginning of a new act and wasn't silver for real, the game sense being impactful is always a nice thing to keep in mind. I'm not really that discouraged (as there will always be ppl that play a lot better than me), it's more annoyance that I can't practice the things I am bad at because the lobbies are too stacked.

One thought I had was that perhaps I play too late in the evening and most of the players still online playing DM are higher rank. Will test it with a few random DMs over the day.

Huge gamebreaking update guys!

>!Absolutely 0 significant changes!<
The best team I ever found in solo quo no toxicity no try hard just pure fun
No
That’s the neat part.  You don’t.
Put ur tracker, there’s no way you placed in ascendant again immediately after rank reset
Neon main

Tip - Practice. Your. Movement. It's saved my ass so many times being able to maneuver around the enemy crosshair and get into a more favorable position. It's not just for flashy clips, Neon movement is as dynamic as you allow it to be.

- Know when to use your movement. If you're in a bad spot, fighting an odin/ares, or in a tight corridor, it may be time to focus on hitting your shots and making good decisions. Neon is a movement agent, but that doesn't mean you can just let your other mechanics fall short.

How to counter Neon

- Don't let her get in your head. Neon's utility is flashy and in your face. If you slow down, concentrate on hitting your shots, she goes down just like any other agent. Neon is very easy to shut out with sentinel utility and a lot of Neon mains like to overheat and run ahead of their team.
"hold on, let him cook, this is where he does his best work"
Perhaps what's needed is a change in perspective. Instead of seeing a higher ranked player and thinking, "damn I'm about to get shit on," try thinking, "damn this guy must suck for his rank," or, "damn, I must be pretty good for my rank to be getting matched with higher ranked players." Look at it as a compliment or a challenge, not a barrier to ranking up.
the issue with outlaw isn't that it's too strong. the problem is that it makes eco/half buy rounds extremely stale. before you could go light shield sheriff and at least have a chance of winning but now you can't because A, light shield just gets deleted by outlaw and B, you need to be able to afford full shield the round after or you'll again just get deleted by outlaw. you now just have 600 credits less to spend in your eco rounds so usually you just decide to keep your classic and completely give up the round instead of trying to win with worse guns
Not griefing. Like the commenter said above, you need to calm down and relax lmao
It does if you set it to press instead of scroll
You’re literally making up your own terms and conditions on the things I said lol. I said if I’m left in a clutch situation like a 1v3-5 with bomb planted and I’m on attack. Or a retake 2v4. I usually win 33% of the time. Yesterday I played 9 games and won 7. I only lose maybe 2/7 of my clutches yesterday. But I also have days where I can hit a shot for my life and lose them all. I do have a high win rate tho just not extremely high it’s like 60% +/-5% depending on how I’m playing that day.
Until next wednesday
Look at this cool video I found about it

https://youtube.com/shorts/yIfm0uCb0mw?si=l16qV-aPvAhjSVtI
you luckyyy broo, if you dont have nbdy else too share it with, can you pass me the code??
Platinum checking in here. Nope, We send this one over to the diamonds.

I've gone mamy games where the first comm out of my team is solely to flame someone.

These are both in games in which I am comming the entire time and silent the entire time.
Its a communication issue  most of the time in my experience, if you talk to team it solves itself
How did you get here?
 movement, crosshair placement, proper clearing and peeking, proper positioning, etc.
As a D1 solo grinder most the time - 30 mins of labs helped me stay competitive with my high Asc Friends (A2 Lobbies). The skill gap is a mix of aim + teamplay mechanics. Almost D3 and hope to end A1.
I'll take one :)
you can see it when going passed the zip line
The only reason I don't get butterfly knifes is because I knew I would pull it twice as much than you

That was a goated luck, gl tomorrow blud I advise you to stay at home
Just never cared for it anymore, and the weapons don't support wraps, which is another reason i don't care.

And i mainly play for fun, not to have best in slot gear.
I was gonna say the same as soon as anyone is toxic on my team I just mute. Those 13 year old aren't worth your time
I understand the 15mins of pregame warmup in range, but for example for me it never helped, only thing that worked was just banging head against wall with the smurf infested ranks until I did break to higher ranks, I do perfectly fine in high D low asc, but if I have to play against silver and gold raynas/jetts, they just massacre everyone in games. I would say only thing that helps is repetition(play many games) get your gamesense to good level and hope your team has better smurf than enemy team
you're in the Save the World subreddit, where we've got neither, but we've got ourselves randomly generated maps, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR
You can go to your act rank and highlight the 0d REMAINING, it will show you the exact time in your local time it will end.
I believe what we really have is tendonosis. I suffer too from this after playing too much CS. I actually wear some arm straps around my forearms to help now.
Tbh, none.
aim train? no. warmup and practice? yes
If it makes you feel any better I feel cursed myself. I hit Diamond a few acts back. I’m over 30 and just don’t have that much time to play so I felt amazing with so few games played to get there. On top of that I use the tracker (Tracker Network) and my tracker score lifetime is 810 which essentially means that I’m always playing at a way above average level to the lobbies I’m in. All of my stats are S tier besides KAST which is B tier (I think this is because I try to dedicate myself to anchoring sites on defense, which is important, but means I’m out of the action in some rounds when teams commit or don’t rotate sites). 




Despite all of that I haven’t been able to hit Diamond again since. It’s probably because I never play enough games to even fill the triangle, but in the games I do play I match MVP roughly 70% of the time but lose a ton. 







It’s really tilting to be super positive to my teammates and communicative no matter what awful plays they make or how toxic people get, only to lose game after game. As time has gone on I play the game less and less because I feel like I have no agency. It’s a team game and I try so hard to play as a team but you can’t control the 4 randoms you get
I'll usually cycle between ammo types, for exampl I'll use like seige breaker or ratatat and other small ammo weapons run out, then switch to medium ammo weapons like floor flusher. Usually I go back and forth and using things like discharger to complement everything, or husk buster. While I'm using one ammo type I'm passively finding more of the other. And I just summed up my load out like a chef does a coarse lol.
I got immortal and kept it for a few seasons till I got tires, never played anything other than Jett, now that I don't play as well as I used to, I really love smokes, such a high impact easy role if you're not brainded
It’s way more than incels. Tons of boys and men just genuinely hate women.
look at cs, didn't change almost anything since 2000
yeah give my man tmv some love actually the only valo creator I watch
It’s the option right next to unrated. It’s just first to 5 round wins
Cubby is without a doubt the rectangle on short. Like the cubby on Haven C long.
No
Basically what cs has but I'm guessing it won't be possible to give someone more than one of those commends (for not buying them)
Simple physics? Fast moving object colliding with a another moving object would change the momentum and trajectory ob both objects. Simplified, you get hit really hard and you stumble or fall dude, not hard to comprehend

And Cypher isn't good on attack either, nor is Sage. They are defense based agents.
I dont think its that deep, i think its literally just because his ult would be broken if he could plant it without being vulnerable or able to be shot. Hope this helps lol
Yeah

Like if it's suddenly announced that Sage was actually born male. Is op suddenly going to stop playing that character just because they aren't biologically female?

I'm confused on what reason they'd only want to play *biologically female" characters is.
I’ll only call out a Cypher if we’re on defense half and he has a trip during the middle of the round. It’s way more common than you’d think in my rank.

Mostly sheriff if ascent or breeze, marshal
Boo hoo
That sucks so much bruh… how many games do I need to play at least a day to cap out KC gain?

Still need to get Raze, Neon, Harbor, Chamber, Astra and now Deadlock. It was already painful enough grinding 200k exp, now its going to be stretched even longer to get all the agents…

Source? This sounds made up, why would you not weight reports where even the enemy team is reporting them even just a little more heavily?
I hope not the 3 hair I have left
This is happening to me to
Hopefully someone has a fix
Op uses the guns cs equivalent to sound cool
Find which map fits your agent pool the best, so examples: Sunset: sova, easy chyper counter, haven: breach, for stunns and it's one of his best maps, and just find the maps that fits the agents you play and simply find your own playstyle that fits with the map and team comp you have, but limiting it to max 3 agents is prob better and if you're better as a initiator then simply look for the most played maps on Sova,Kayo and breach and find playbooks of higher elo players don't copy the, 100% but have them in your mind on how they play the agents on said maps then tweak it to fit your team comps and playstyle
Thanks
Having recently graduated from diamond kindergarten, lots of guys with cracked aim that just take such bad fights.
Just pick Reyna, and squish the enemies
[removed]
I think they are talking about the firework launcher things
They literally updated Survive the Horde (the map) and changed around the difficulty & kinda how you were playing the mode compared to last year

  
And that came out LESS THAN A WEEK ago.

  
STW is getting updates, hero & weapon changes, new features, new guns & heroes

  
Not as frequent as we used to have but still nonetheless are getting new content
Am I?
Ive updated my graphics driver, still not

Only reason I haven’t done the final upgrade yet. Until riot figures out how to select versions and go back on upgrades I may hold out on purchasing the voice lines. I think it’s dope but idk I feel like everything else in the package is good enough to use without voice.
It was like a month ago so I can't 😭😭😭 sry boy
that is such a lie 💀
I don't think it's as simple as throwing money at the problem though
Well im not complaining if its viper or reyna.
I didn't realize broadside traps weren't great. They're the only trap I leveled up so far 😭
If I were to agree with you, we'd both be wrong
70% of controllers I get in gold-diamond lobbies dont say a word or even listen to anything other then info on the enemies. Or just do their own stupid shit in spite of me asking for some conventional smokes to entry a site. 

Not always ofc, but I rarely see any teammate that would even try to listen so it isnt worth effort to try to make any comms with your team at all and just duo-trio qing instead is what I do
Not being as good anymore as you used to be.

For example a friend of mine was D2, but he recently took a long break and now deranked all the way to Gold because he's simply not that good as he used to be. 

This would make him "washed".
It would probably be like Overwatch with a PC pool and a Controller pool, with cross play in unrated for parties, but aim assist being taken away in cross play. I can't see it causing issues.
"low" and "high" are often used in very subjective manners, I don't see why he'd be wrong to define them according to the player base pourcentage. 

I recall charlatan saying everything below immortal is low elo, that's a point of view but it really means nothing.
Your mouse sensitivity is almost certainly way too high to allow you to actually aim. What's your mouse DPI and in-game sens?
During a Swiftplay, he was super nice and good comms wanted to be friends and duo which is where I found out the real him. He was toxic, homophobic, racist and much more during 1 game to our teammates & opponents smh. Insta blocked and reported 😀
Nope he is a terrible agent for any decent level play but for everyone else yeah he may be viable. It’s the same as 5 duelist. If you’re platinum sure you can run 5 duelist and be fine but in ascendant+ it just won’t work
To be fair, I was Diamond 1, and after the reset , I was dropped to Gold !. Sometimes it's not the players fault but the stupid ranking system.
Please 🙏🏻
People just forgor how generations work and call people a boomer/millennial/genz depending on how they behave. The "Baby boomers" generation is people born between 1945 and 1964, you are barely even a millennial and almost a gen z.
Yes but having them be well made wouldn't lead to there being more in at once, at least for standard modes
Gotta be kind to receive kindness brother

Of course it’s viable, all heroes/weapons are (to varying degrees of effect). Back in the day Spin2Win Scythe builds with healing used to be great because you were an immortal beyblade spawn killing everything. Nowadays you’re looking more at Ninja builds that focus on their Abilities, but certainly melee as a whole is still viable, in fact with the Dinosaur heroes Ninjas have a way of negating their original crappy “I’m a sponge for damage” stats where they’d die pretty easily if they were trying to melee Husks whilst getting shot by all the hitscan enemies. I think it’s Dragon Scorch that I’ve seen doing great in 160s, and of course Lynx is up there for your “MSK essentials” of a build. 


Play whatever you like, as long as you’re trying your best to do the objective you can run whatever you like

so it doesn't look like a character mid round and confuse the enemy
As a Yoru OTP, I second this. Let’s make it so as Yoru I don’t have to disassemble then reassemble my gun before being able to shoot after coming out of my TP or ult. To get a good flash tp to work I have to either tp slightly before the flash goes off meaning they’ll see my general position before the flash comes in, or I need them to get flashed by the clone for them to be blinded after I tp. If I tp as the Q flash goes off, by the time my guns up the blind is down and im just strafing after my tp waiting to be able to shoot and essentially just taking a 50-50 backsite. Even worse if they don’t get full flashed im instantly dead.

Now I get it, im just a Yoru main complaining that he isn’t op I know I know. But if Jett’s so strong why can’t Yoru get a little better too. It feels like I need to have a 5head play every round to make a big impact but with Jett you can use a smoke and a dash and have just as good impact.

Lmk if anyone else feels the same way about their dualists they play.
deleting this cuz the title has wrong info
Wrong sub lmaooo
Well I do have a surround setup in my living room but can't really play there. But then yk If you have pretty good comms ig I would survive
Microsoft membrane keyboard 600, immortal 1 lol
As others have said, not a hack or aimbot. You just don't know there are multiple weapons that shoot through objects. What you witnessed was the Xenon Bow (the other piercing weapons are the Obliterator and the Ghost Pistol). 

As for the "aimbot", as soon as you damaged one of the enemies a health bar appeared over its head, visible to your teammates even from underground. Anyone who's practiced enough with the Xenon Bow can easily make that shot by aiming slightly below the bar.
I don't understand the way Riot nerfs and buffs agents.

Too often the changes are massive, in one release. This indicates that they went months without changes, and that their design and tuning of the agent was originally very poor. This shouldn't be happening period. Their balancing team should be better.

It's been established for decades now that smaller incremental/iterative changes to release to your users for feedback is more valuable to both users and the company providing the product. Faster failure and feedback is simply better than longer durations between releases with less feedback for everyone. 

The multiple release of changes to Jett was justified. Changes were small, feedback was gained, users understood and accepted the changes, and practically the whole community understood the change to Jett's dash. Now, she's still a viable agent with pro-play.

Contrast that with Astra. 10 nerfs to her in one release. Now she's practically forgotten with the lowest pick rate and one of the low winrates to match. Omen's also picked practically at every turn over her in pro-play. She's been like this for months with no changes. 

Now we have Neon who has needed buffs, but is she not overtuned for this release? What about the Ares buff? 

On top of that, when we're nerfing abilities, why is it typically nerfing the function of the ability, and then ALSO decreasing QTY, and INCREASING price? Yes, I understand the need to nerf abilities, but was the ability originally designed in such a way that it needs nerfs to the function, qty, AND price?
I’ve made it to bronze 2 with an average ping of around 28-32 and a few times per game it spike to the hundreds
1 Kill per round is decent
You're saying the last line was good. I agree with 5 stacking but I enjoy playing alone, because that teaches me discipline, more art of clutching. I know this sounds dumb. Anyways, Thanks for being so positive
your epic?
First of all, I rarely meet girls in my matches with randoms, though it could be because they tend to prefer party chat over team chat.

Now, the ones who were my friends' friend often chose Sage (much to my dismay, as I used to love playing Sage) but the ones I met in random matches mostly chose different agents.

And you mentioned in one of your comments that you have not seen them playing agents like Reyna or Jett. I believe it could be because if you can't perform well with these agents, you might be flamed by your teammates, and wouldn't you expect it to be worse if they find out you're a girl? 

So, I believe that most of them just don't do team chat when they use such a agent.
Val needs calm aim, Overwatch Apex and TF2 needs very flicky and fast aim

ofc your friend who plays CSGO, which is way similar to Valorant than Overwatch Apex and TF2

just keep playing you'll get better eventually
33 now , you have to be physically fit now. your reaction times will thank you. people don't want to and think they can just grind kovaaks and aimlabs. When I started working out consistently I was hitting immortal solo.
>I've never seen more than 4 ACTIVE, PLAYING, SHOOTING, ETC in a mission

I've never seen more than 2 doing those things playing with randoms XD
my bus driver is gonna have me get paid for watching her farm animals
Hmm. Still, the last work work for SSDs. I need to start twine so maybe I’ll look it up. Idk. 

Going to miss the glitch a little when it leaves. Seems like husky’s and smashers can often have way too much health. Might be because my squads are complete, but even in ventures 108 with 120 weapons it can take most of a clip to kill normal husks. Ran a match the other day with 2 people using over 400 rockets total and I could hardly kill one fire smashed in a venture. Insane.
That would be hard, as it requires a human person to test these ingame, and who has human persons to do such activities with him anyway.
I agree with you on the majority of this, but the main design for duelists isn’t getting kills. Duelists are designed to create and take space for their team, or assist them in doing so. This is why a lot of times you’ll see a mid-frag duelist contributing more to the team than a top-frag who doesn’t prioritize assisting the team. A very popular stereotype is the lurking Reyna, and a very common retort is that, they’re getting more kills than the rest of the team so clearly they’re doing their job. This is, of course, incorrect.

Valorant’s main objective is the bomb-site, not the enemy team. A lot of duelists forget this which is why so many people complain about your friendly-neighborhood instalock Jett.
Is there really no fix??? Lmaoo
Well you learn something everyday
Harbor OP? Wasn't the sub saying he was dogshit not too long ago? As soon as someone plays him in pro play he's now good and op. Lol
Well, no.

This would only be the case if op's team didn't have a smoke agent when he was picking Reyna. Otherwise his steam still has a smokes character when he's on Reyna, so your point is invalid. We'd need to see op's tracker to see his matches, but I can pretty much guarantee you that there were almost always controllers on his team when he was picking Reyna.

In reality, the likely explanation is that 1) it's a small sample size so just random chance; or 2) Reyna coerces you into playing poorly by making you be overly aggressive and taking poor fights while Viper promotes patience.
Can confirm is still a bug and if you’re holding bomb it doesn’t get dropped (anywhere). Omen ends up with it while dead. Very fun game. Thanks riot for hard coding deadlock scenarios and forgetting to call death.super (it’s C idc)
The other guy made excellent points! I just want to point out, the storage of Radianite in crates is a very Kingdom-specific action. Lotus, for example, has a *ton* of Radianite lying around - you just don't see all of it in the typical green boxes.

For example, some of the Radianite is stored in the blue wall panels that you find scattered on the walls and ceilings. That is just the way the Astral Guardians who built the city chose to keep their radianite.

I haven't gotten the chance to look at Lotus myself yet, since its not yet come out in my region, but I'm very confident that it's gonna be the same case here.
That's what I was thinking
Yes so annoying, they introduce more and more bugs every update..
If i got a server in my own city ofc I'll go play in it because of the low ping but they keep being disrespectful everytime i respond

You mean a passive? Several other agents have passives, such as Phoenix healing with fire or Gekko's globules to name a few
Yoru ult or tp for easy save
It’s not. I’m usually top frag on iso but I still don’t win that many ults
The old UI is so cluttered and barely readable. It was probably always just a placeholder.
For me it’s the new map. I can’t wait to see how it will looks like
Does it though? Sure movement speed is higher and tracking is more important but in valorant you need to be extremely precise with your positioning and game sense is extremely harder to develop for valorant. I really think that being the best at valorant is just as hard as being the best at apex
Actually, I've seen smashers who get confused by the half walls and just walk around without breaking walls.
Can someone tell me why matchups like this are possible?

Team A
3x D1, 2x Plat 3 (3-stack + 2 soloq)

Team B
3x Plat 3, 2x Plat (2-stack + 3 soloq)

It's unbalanced af.
Iron 2, way too long
And this is what lol one in a hundred games what a pointless post.
Sounds like they just use their head. Go one round b and there is no cypher. So they go again and again and still no cypher.
That's good advice for hitting a peak, but not going to help improve overall.

Op needs to play more and play with his brain turned on. Every round is a learning opportunity. Just hitting play and hoping to do better isn't going to get them anywhere.  It sounds like he's practicing mechanics but ignoring everything else.
Just play swift play. Same thing as Unrated but faster. They can experience different maps, using different agents and using different guns without having to commit to a 20 min+ game.

If they are really trying to get into the game, watch some streamers when not playing to understand more.

Let’s wait a couple of weeks. Day one “conclusions” are always anecdotal at best.
Yeah I see xD But... I mean, if I were new to the game, just ranked in, and then swift with Immo, Dia Plat, Plat? Idk if I woudn't quit the game after that xD
And I'd take all of that to have it bug free to be honest.
which is what the whole point of what i was saying was. i know what a secondary duelist is. I was stating that iso, just like the other duelists like him are played in extremely rare cases in VCT and if one is picked phoenix and reyna are much better options
Do you find the game is now boring with no quests?

Do you have trouble choosing what to play with no guidance from quests?

Do you have a slave mindset?
thats wrong the refreshrate of an mouse is frequenz most gaming mice have 1000 hz, office mice mostly have 125- 500hz  


DPI is dots per inch or cpi clicks per inch, and tells how often an inch is devided, 2000dpi devides an inch into 2000 units so it's more precice where you moved your mouse. Therefor 2000dpi is twice as fast as 1000 because the distance betwenn clicks is half.      
and don't confuse it with dpi from printing, this is also dots per inch. but tells how many colordots the printing has per inch or how many many pixel a image need to be printed in a specific size.
Yeah. I took a break 2022-recently but started playing a little after killjoy came out and in my experience, both cypher and her have been relatively strong/balanced characters who usually appeared somewhat high on the meta.
Clove has low skill ceiling though, with reyna or jett you can get ace’s but with Clove you’re only supporting
Maby you were decayed?
Yep. And their egos are through the roof.
Thats a pretty good idea for a subtle valo tattoo, especially for the squad!

Then if that is what you're looking for, I personally think the game looks great in 2k. Stuff like low res/stretched/etc is either a habitual thing from previous games or its a case of a super high level player looking to optimize. For everyone else, the difference between 24" 1080p and 27" 1440p is maybe representative of 0.5% of your rank (meaning your grand total RR would be 0.5% higher if you went from less optimal to most optimal). 

However, going from 1080p to 1440p made the game look a lot nicer to me so I consider the tradeoff worth it. My pro career at age 30+ may not happen but at least my skins will look nice :D
I only played episode 1 act 1 and episode 8 act 1-3 i have 600. Did they just used to give alot back then?
Breeze Haven and Fracture just own me
If your valorant password is the same as your email password then i would def change it real quick. (Because then yes). If its (completely) different then u would (if you dont change the password) "just" lose your riot account.

Love it. However, there needs to be bigger emphasis on the abilities. Here's what I'd personally change: Recharge on all abilities on death, or at least E, have ULT increase by kill & death as well, and have recharge time reduced.
Mechanical Skill. (A3)
Nocturno and Quickshot are most definitely tier SS weapons. Are they worth $1000? Obviously not.
Doesn’t make it not rude
Anti-cuddle Sarah
you aim with ur arm or wrist? by what i see i assume u aim with arm or may be your mouse accel is on and thats why you overflick
Yes , you should instalock jett . After playing a hella lot of games I came to realization even winning or losing play what you like but not what others tell you to play
Play the character you have fun with. Playing towards the meta will make you lose interest faster.
Well depends, sometime I have bad games where I’m not into the game you know so I miss all my shots, looses easy dual,clutch  where I usuallly would not. 
So I just triy to think that there are not into the game yet, or they maybe talking with their parents or things like that. So that helps a bit.

Then If I see that they are actually not even trying, I don’t go out and talk shit, I try to motivate them, encourage and shit.

If it does not work. It just put some music and try my best to have some fun, uses Ares or Odin etc etc.

If it’s ranked… I just focus even harder.
If I win the game I have a headache, but a win 
If I lose …. Well headache and a loose so I just stop playing for a few hours
your post is so boring that nobody else decided to comment. sorry for trying to engage in discussion.
A day. I just wanted the Prime Vandal and just bought a gift card. Went home the next day and it's in store, lol. Convenient as it appeared about 2 days ago for me and I thought I had to wait a long time before it reappeared.

Latency and packetloss, Server ignoring what you're doing even if client side shows otherwise.

Welcome to what it's like to play ALL the time for me.

Nothing like watching other players run FULL SPEED across structures they are building at the same time.. while i, often, have to place a structure, can take multiple attempts for it to start building, and then run to the next edge and wait... 

Game is a mess since epic in all their idiocy decides to change it from PVE mode to PVP in how server handles client data.
Try a new crosshair, even shroud agrees a bigger crosshair is better for val, when I used a tiny plus crosshair it was so difficult putting one tiny pixel on the other. When I made it bigger I flew from stuck d1 to asc1 in like a week. Also arm positioning and mouse grip, if my arm isn’t at the perfect height and angle I’m missing every shot.
Yes please
Why are you talking like you're good at the game? Checked ur post history and gotta say Indian players in esports are the worst in any game aside from eating curry simulator. GG scammer.
Top 3 map for me
Console in general is more toxic IMO
100% because A site has a natural fork it means you don't need to have a duel to make space to enter site.
Those aren’t even absurd odds…

You ended your sentence with “but”. Did the remaining get deleted?
Tip is to not think on the refresh rate and blame it if you play bad.
I never Said i need a good Team to win. I so perfectly fine Without. It's Just a worse experience then
Who on attack swings and instantly holds for the jumpspot? The attackers would likely jumpspot themselves, use some utility or peek looking at a common position, not for the jump peek. 

I totally agree that people on defense will hold for attacker jump peeks, but almost never the other way around.

Thanks! If you lowered your sens before to 0.13, did it like entirely change how you started to aim? Maybe used your arm more?
Get a Hall effect or electrostatic controller
No, they haven’t. 4 years in we’re still on a replay system? This is one of the bare essentials for any competitive shooter.

Elderflame was the first ever bundle to release. It's under rated. I never see people use any of the skins
its better than it used to be. They buffed it at some point. Like they mentioned fragment generation is better but its an amazing pick and is super strong as a lead too. The base phys holds it back imo which is why I like Cyberclops a bit more but not a ton
IMO, Swiftplay gives a lot of XP. Hopefully you'll be lvl 20 by the time you get your new laptop and can jump right into Competitive by that time!
I hope it comes back. Because I like playing against the hard bots to warm up
Tysm. I actually might grab her over omen then cause I have clove for when I want to fight a lot. This is such a sick overview.
you weird as fuck for this tbh
Any flash character or molly character good to go
Same. I dropped off after peaking D3. Took a bit of a 2 year slow down because I had 2 kids back to back.
Now for the life of me, my mechanics just aren’t coming back. I still have the game-sense, I just cannot hit my shots. I don’t have time for aim labs and warming up the way I used to, so I’ve accepted my Gold placement and being frustrated with people who shoot better than me but don’t want to or know how to play as a team

So basically. You and your boyfriend are the epitome of problematic edaters.

Your BF is smurfing and ruining every lobby, you're supporting him to help him smurf better.

You don't know jackshit about the game.

You get angry and talk back when people call you out on your bullshit.

You go and play competitive, instead of unrated, which is where you belong.

You both are trash for making a 5 player game on to a 2 player game.
Splatoon lives off Gyro
The game engagement optimized matchmaking. The matchmaking is broken. Keep playing if you have fun playing. Stop if you don’t. Simple as that.
You are part of the problem. You just enjoy ruining people's day don't you?
Phoenix is super viable in ranked already. His flash and ult are S+ tier, molly is great and wall can also be super useful sometimes.
Origin stays #1
Yeah no. Compared to the icon it gives way more info
This isn't necessarily about Guns, but what are the "best" Wall, ground, and ceiling traps?
most of it are, there some that are creative but i forgot what it was, the generic valo duo names are cringe
Buy one Odin, dont die fir a round or two.  Plenty of money.
Your damage / round, hs % and KD are all too low I think, especially kd and damage /round are really low. Maybe just practice gunfight hygiene ( then again I'm g3 myself so don't take my advice too seriously)

From what I've heard, Immortal+ games don't take individual stats into account and base it mostly on the score and whether you win or lose. The more you climb the amount of RR you lose will either be the same or more than the RR you win per game.
honestly felt. if you want some advice on that part, just make sure you always stay true to yourself and never change how you act or the hobbies you enjoy just to fit in to a new crowd. i made that mistake and it hurts 100x more when the facade inevitably crumbles. best of luck tho
love the name, rip jiraiya

I cannot make friends I have no friends online or in real life, I have not come across a single person since 2019 who knew how to build effectively in a random game, I run into the lowest caliber of player possible. I can't build everything every mission I don't have the resources to keep up with it anymore, this is a 160 rtd you need more than 10 traps you need tunnels, i cant do everything the other player can't eirher we can't do it all and the other way to players stand there do nothing whell we can't do it by myself anymore i cant do it nobody is helping in my games i cant play the missions i want to play anymore because nobody is helping me everyone is saying to not use traps anymore and no skill just using guns i cant do that it's not correct the game needs skill to play it  i cant do it anymore
You can actually intercept the messages going to the xmpp server instead of using ocr, this is much more performant.
shoot where they gonna be.
The mini boss that spawned at the horns was at the first horn strike well before the 10 minute mark. That's interesting though that mini bosses can spawn on high platforms. I figured the whole point of not building ramps or stairs was so the zombies couldn't walk up to you. Additionally, the storm shrink I mentioned at the first horn strike was also well within the 10 minute mark and after the mini MSK boss was defeated.
There already a degree of randomness to agents as it is already. You don’t know who you’re up against until you load into the map. Put more effort into your games than your complaints, you’ll find that you can learn and overcome your Le.
Any constructor 😅
Just entered gold. So gold 3 or gold 1. Whatever one it starts at.

How could have sage used the wall better? Blocked off on both sides. Yes, someone did manage to hop in which is a problem because now they're protected by walls on both sides (unless I'm breach)
Recon phantom is probably the most loved/best phantom skin in the game
Rank has nothing to do w this lol. I'm imm3 and the only logical conclusion is that OP doesn't playe enough.
Is it a disadvantage for me if I play on a 10 year old pc? I can get 100-160fps on medium but cap it at 66hz because of screen tearing from overclocking monitor. Would a better screen make a huge difference?
[removed]
correct. unless you can out aim the enemies (which you don't most of the time in the pure non smurf lobby. its 50/50 fight), chambers bring less values than kj/cypher. that is all im trying to say and i got swarmed by all thechamber mains.
Just because its a PVE game (mode) doesn't mean there should be no skill required to play at all. The requirement of skill for actions, and less skill being punished/more skill being rewarded is what makes a game a game and not a toy.

A toggle doesn't work because then people would remove it. People will remove any kind of rockyness in the gameplay even if the rockness is better for the game overall, and you can't experience being able to be better than others at the game, if they aren't dealing with the same things.

Why not have a toggle that halves all enemy damage? Enemies doing damage is annoying, we are playing PVE, no skill should be required if i don't want to.
Age is not the issue, you just need to put 30-60 mins extra everyday for aim training and vod review. Reaction time does not matter as much as you think.

Take what info you know, and use it to the best of your ability. If it just went from a 2v1 to a 1v1 and your teammate that just died says they're b art on Harbor and you're b site, watch b art, you have no need to push, especially if you have spike down on attacker or have control of Spike on defender. If you hear multiple sets of footsteps coming from a section that you can't see, but can hear if they're not quiet, call out to your teamates that you saw "multiple people *location*!", and position yourself to get the best possible angle on all of them
i hate those names man its always some kid faking an eastern accent acting like hes not bottom fragging lol
where are you getting all these hate because i mostly get funny randoms roleplaying the agent they playing and emoting around (i’m a girl too and never experienced discrimination)
just had my first kid and I like playing when she's asleep late at night. I'm terrible (hard stuck on bronze for like 6 months) but I couldn't care less.
Looking for NA PS5 code dm please
You can try agents in the practice range
There’s a couple scenarios where 1 person running a ghost/full shield makes sense: a lurker  (you don’t want to give a gun to the enemy), and saving for op. 

IMO, you shouldn’t have more than 1 person on a pistol in uncoordinated play. In team play, you can make it work with 2 people on pistols to make your bonus better buuut that’s way too risky in ranked.
And with the 3 sites it becomes unbearable with trying to retake site
This game is extremely buggy, and unfortunately it’s probably gonna stay that way.
>are they trying to turn this twitch based shooter into a twitch based shooter??
Skye is hands down the best initiator in the game and arguably the best agent overall
You lost me when you said healing is one of her good skills.
Seems like a Duo/trio Queuing issue to me. I play on my alt with my friends and I face this same thing. I lose less RR and gain less RR since the system knows which rank I belong at and tries to keep me there itself.
who care about flank detection and you can always pick other sentinel if that what you care

even pro team don't run sentinel on every map  
a lot of comp don't use sentinel  
except some map that like their home like kj on lotus, icebox and cypher on breeze
VOD REVIEW is the only way

Violates terms of service. Will get the person who purchases, likely banned.
As a person who is also new and played my first few ranked games, I’m glad they made me wait that long because playing unrated gave me time to learn my agent (as well as other agents), get better game sense, practice my aim, and get to play without worrying about my new gameplay dragging my players down the ranks. Also in unrated there’s more people willing to help you actually learn the game while in ranked they’ll just yell at you for not being the best valorant player ever
I think it’s good to get feedback in all groups but STW players aren’t on creative as much as you’d think lol but I am! I a creator as well!
A lot of that is pretty accurate. Some other things to note are that MVP (ACS) is not actually considered anywhere in MMR/RR and there is more information about how Encounter MMR works in the general Ranked FAQ page.
You’ve got yourself a deal 🤝
This may sound silly, but try playing the game just a little bit. This only works if you have sufficient hardware, so if you try to play Valorant but your computer can't run it even on the lowest settings I guess this doesn't apply to you.

I know that you don't really feel the need to play the game seriously, and that's okay! You never even have to queue up for a ranked game. The reason I'm suggesting this is that even just playing the game for a little bit will massively increase the knowledge you have of the game. During those first maybe 10-20 games, the amount that you learn about the basic structure of the game is huge!

If you do decide to play some unrated games, good luck and have fun.

In addition, I also recommend watching Woohoojin regardless of whether you take my previous advice or not. I learned a lot about the game from him.
It was last ep diamond and i guess they could’ve been boosted
I've always thought that we need a more clear indicator of low hp and ammo.  
That pale red around the HUD it's barely visible lol
People tend to just sign up (to anything) using an age older than they are, if their actual age isnt above the minimum
Agressive breach play are always the best
Honestly chronovoid feels so bad -50%HS
Oh good point
Don't forget to kill glowing animals to, they can drop weapons/traps and materials
Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/s/S4GiXoe8sA
They released the karambit in that one battle pass and have been back pedaling since.
Tbh that is the best thing they did, i play in the middle east server and the server is dead except when v-bucks mission is live, i always play in europe and risk my ping just to play with full players lobby.
you want no casters for the live audience? I would not have attended VCT lol. The caster hype is needed and a lot of the times there's a lot of back and forth between the casters and the audience which is absolutely audible on stream.
Are you trying hard to keep it still in both cases. It almost sounds like tensing up to remain still which is like the worst thing you can do. Just relax and let the muscle be loose maybe
You know those times where the whole enemy team peeks a corner running full sprint and you’re aiming there, and you start spraying and get maybe 2-3 kills before the other guys murder you?

Imagine if you automatically got a damage instance shield on each of those kills lmao

You probably only die when you do in those situations because each person gets 1-2 body shots on you, OR 1 person gets a headshot 

Auto double tap would make a player that’s in a 1vX an absolute force of nature
Something rly funny and i stop ranting : We did a win yesterday i finished with 289 AVG combat score (with 25kill) He finished with 182 AVG and 15kill BUT TOOK 17 POINT like ME

Never give up. Never what?
Reyna because I can take new aim duels after getting hit if I get a kill. She gives me the confidence to go ham.
I play one agent per map and got my agent taken like once in a few hundred games. You might need an SSD if this is more common for you. Or you play Reyna which is unlucky
Wow

I can't even see people that far away, let alone kill them.
I prefer highlights type of videos>>> montages anyday
Xim "uses" PS5 controllers via remote play. 

A for effort tho.
my best idea would be to inflate the RR by the performance. For example, if you have a pretty good game you normally would get around 20-30 RR, give bonus! if you have 3 games like that in a row you get an extra 50RR. A Silver/gold might have a good game and go 30-0 but he wont do that constantly, if the smurf keeps performing he will get out of low leagues in a matter of 10 or so games.
At your rank my best advice is to play WHATEVER you’re comfortable with. Focus on your own individual skill and presence in the game. 

Even in higher ranks, people still play towards their comfort within reason. 

The only rule people really stick even in radiant is to make sure you have smokes, initiator and sentinel. 

Glhf!
It's presumably because you play yoru bruh
Ok but like how TF am I supposed to play Breeze now as solo controller?
I need one 2
Hey! I noticed you were talking about V-Bucks. I sell them dirt cheap! Add me on discord: tridvajedan
fully agree. I think its also weird how modern she seems despite being immortal, youd imagine shed be more classical looking
Had the same problem. What i did is to say Hello and then in the Round a few Callouts and if nobody responds i stopped it. Didn‘t bother to give callouts when i didn’t receive any. And it‘s even funnier when Teammates get mad at you for stopping and all of a sudden every can insult and type in the Chat or use their microphone
I use Clip but the energy still load not fast enough like it was before new season
love it but please i beg i’ve had valor at points for 1+ Mon and still not a singe good skin
TYSM!!!!
all of them already fixed a year ago
I actually cannot scrape a win together. I think I have like a 33 win rate and I was d1 last act. Now I’m g3 and I’m low frags every round. Idk if it’s skill diff or lobbies or I’m boosted (I solo que so idk how that fesible

please share it to me bro if you get one
I get report feedback all the time. It's easier to get someone punished if they've used text chat. Voice chat isn't recorded so they can't possibly know what's being said. They would only punish if they had a lot of reports about the same thing. Typing the N word once in chat gets you chat banned instanly anyway.
why do you think this never happens to most people?

I dont see what the point of this post is, but as it stands all STW weapons would be too overpowered for BR unless they had there stats extremely lowered.
it feel like valorant have been trying to shove this weird electro edm kpop genre down our throats for years now and honestly its just not very good. i feel like its pretty common to feel that the only good valorant song was die for you and that one with bbno$ was really hype, but they kindof butchered it by giving him literally only a scentance.
Ppl who play val*
No, i wrote that it doesnt matter, i just play agents that contribute to the team as smokes are kind of strong against op players. Also playing the agent wrong decreases the changes of winning, not the bad agent. People consistently win with any agent on solo q to immortal so why cant you? Youre just mad cuz people dont know how to play the agent they picked, no need to get personal
in fact reyna blind is useful if used correctly but in most cases it becomes shit, if the enemy player knows how to counter reyna blind
Holy shit with these OF bots flooding every sub:/
The entire tech industry is going thru lay offs because the covid bubble bursting, but go ahead
Literally look up teen debit system smh. And it doesn’t matter if it’s their main money making, not to mention the fact that it’s not only for broke people, some people might want to give their friend a valorant skin but they themselves don’t play games much so they don’t have a good enough pc to run it or enough storage, and seeing as it is technically illegal to go onto someone’s account without permission theyd have to ask for permission to go onto the pc then they’d make their own account.

Anyone have a spare code
Spent 60 hours smurfing, and OP doesn't even see a problem with it. It's hilarious.
Give people the ability of anonymity and they will show their true, unfiltered selves.
For $400 half the price I feel like I can guarantee any player diamond at least
i'd rather have a good extra duelist/sentinel than a bad controller
Crazy?!? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room, a rubber room, a rubber room with rats, and they made me crazy.
Bro what is this crosshair
**You can't**, it's against the developers' terms of service, and could get the account banned
You cannot retroactively get vbucks for anything you've already completed.
I know people who like icebox (i'm neutral on it).
Just more practice to get used to it bud, I adapted pretty fast because it felt better to me. The crouch walking change made sense too. No issues here. I have like 20 crown wins atm
Ahh so my hunch was right, thank you
If you're holding an angle dont aim too close to the wall, give a little space for reaction time.
No comment
I agree. Love people able to throw tele and hold somewhere then rotate to team. My friends play well when I ult in and give coms.
Like not even for 1-2 rounds?
stop reloading every 3 seconds. need higher crosshair placement. stop staring at the ground whenever moving/rotating. always keep crosshair head level and keep your guard up with pre-aiming. stop crouch + spray spamming when you see an enemy.
Ill get there one day.. im sure 🥲
[removed]
my motto is as long as they buy themselves and i have time to buy my stuff, sure, i’ll give them the skin. but mine is also sentinels of light and singularity for vandal/phantom, so i guess not as popular, but still get asked at least once every 10 games, so a bit annoying but nothing as bad as getting begged almost every game
It's pretty much anyone but duelist. Something to consider is ult utility so someone like KJ planting can be good to build up ult quicker.
Yeah these people are worse than anything op is describing
1. understand that players in general are not good at all. don't psych yourself out into thinking people are actually good at the game.

2. aiming is simple in valo, 1 - 5m run spray, 10m - 15m connect and spray, over that it is purely burst and strafe back and forth. to aim head level just lock your cursor to your teammates head in spawn and hold it there for the rest of the game. you will learn pretty quickly how you will have to adjust for different ranges

3. make it easy on yourself. find out what works and what doesn't in ranked. like i said ranked isn't coordinated. play duelist or whatever you feel can win games. example: fight mid on haven with 2 on b, 1 walking on the left hand side the other watching for the window peek, and 1 in garage waiting to peek on a flash or contact from the b player walking down mid. sure this takes coordination but if you can learn to guide teammates games become much easier.

4. play 2 games a day max. all other time should be spent learning call outs, line ups, wall bang spots.

5. apply these new line ups, call outs into an actual ranked game. that is the only way you will learn them. you WILL LOSE, that is OK. it will get worse before it gets better.

6. people say "have fun" but it will not be fun. solo queue is ultimately NOT fun. set smaller goals first.

7. sitting in a custom and learning 1 or 2 things about a map is infinitely more useful than queuing up a deathmatch. deathmatch just tells you where they can be, which you already know conceptually.

8. if you're safe look at the minimap, and try to maximize your efficiency by positioning yourself to collect easy frags.
Epic what the actual fuck?

absolutely the polar opposite, dx12 should give a boost in performance, specially in miniumums
In case you missed it, there's also swift play, which is a shorter unrated.
Used to main raze, picked up breach and loved his play style and branched out to kay//o and I flip flop between them based on the map
Are those the statements that the valorant support person specifically stated were/were not against the rules?  Because I’m pretty sure there’s going to be more to this story than that…

But it does tell you on the kill feed
The 3D resolution bar should be at least at 75%. Higher looks better but also makes the game slower if you have a low-tier PC
More often than not you can spot cheaters by looking at if they have a wide disparity in skill. They'll have exceptional flicks but position like a bronze for instance. There are those who also try to hide it, but I think most people who rely on cheats as a crutch never have to learn how to play properly to get to the relevant rank, so there's generally glaring flaws atypical of the rank you are in. But yes, replays really do highlight cheating. 

Before I really got into competitive scenes I played a bit of CSGO with friends, mainly the competitive mode. For a middling rank it felt like we had some matches against same crazy players and replays always looked suspicious on these people, found the chrome extension that checks for banned players in previous matches and it was actually absurd how many people were getting banned a few weeks after these matches. A few years later when I tried faceit for the first time and started getting competitive with games I finally realised why everyone went to those external systems.
i gotchu if u do the same
Is there a way to get a debit card online, again I want to use my free credits I already have (the octupus group creds are also free)
[removed]
Yeah I get your point and I can see how some agents would not benefit from the outlaw as much.

If you’re playing a Jett/Chamber or if you simply prefer long range combats and you know your enemy is in that eco range, I do think that one outlaw on the team can be a sort of a replacement to the op. It’s powerful enough to guarantee kills to the body in this situation yet not economically risky as the op and not as beneficial to the enemy team if they get their hands on it.

I see your point with aggressive agents like Yoru and Reyna that wouldn’t really benefit from the outlaw and would prefer a rifle/smg for close quarters combat, or if you’re a sentinel playing off util close range then an outlaw would be more detrimental.

I do believe that the outlaw has a place in the game. However, it’s not very predominant and I think it will only excel in specific situations with the right agents.
Casual community tends to have ass PCs
its not just you. this is the worst map pool in a long time
It's not.  You jumped the gun on the initial comment, but he's obviously upset about something else.
Save the world having both missions and free roam could work but to scrap missions completely for cartoon minecraft is a terrible idea.

Finish Twine -> Make spectral cliffs. The biggest things they should do currently.

What other game allows me to build defences around a van that can fly whilst destroying zombies with an energy bow, whilst I listen in on story about how the cast planned the worst Christmas ever?
\*SINGLE BIGGEST REASON i dont party in Canny\* ............There are often times you'll load in a match where the objective is sitting near a fukin hill. AND YOU CANT BUILD INTO THE HILL.  


so instead of, lets just say for example (POOR example)........building a standard pyramid for the Atlas with just 15 pieces.........you have to burn through 32 of the fuckers ALL BECAUSE you NOW have to cover the ENTIRETY OF THE FUCKING HILL.  


It happened WAAAY too damn much when i was in there the first time.   


Now..........unless its an encampment mission or me doing quests.....im not risking burning out an ass-ton of building pieces just to cover the fact that we cant build through terrain.
This is def the first time I've seen someone with this suggestion! /s
he trollin
it's nowhere near accurate.... It might put you in the ballpark..... give or take 100+ days
huh
I don't know what's your elo. I'm low elo and tbh I'd prefer people getting into the habit of using their ults more than them saving the ult for that perfect time. I'm trying to do that myself, and I'll use my ult even when it's not that one perfect occasion. So many times I've seen people not use their ult at all during a half while I've used it 3 times. Even if I can only get 40% of the value of a perfect use case, using it 3x is 120% value vs. using it once per half at 100% (or less, or not using it all)
Valorant mobile is a thing. I don't know much about it but I think its only in China right now and its not fully released. Maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong

I hope that guy enjoys being hard stuck plat/diamond for the rest of his existence 😂
1 in 5 games have fun people, 2 in 5 games have quiet no coms people, 2 in 5 games have rude and throwers, and lastly 4 in 5 games have a smurf that is literally the only guy getting kills in the enemy team
I'm the opposite to you - I feel the valorant maps are more unique and fresh compared to CS - especially with map features likes TPs and revolving doors. The meta around agents and executes changes constantly in valorant 

All CS maps have been the same executes and plays for 30 years. It gets old real quick. I'm tired of spawning CT inferno and yeeting my whole until down banana for the last 10 years
Your game wont lwt me choose a character times out and gives me a warning for que dodgding remove the punishment system until tou fix toue game idiots
It’s not surprising that some people who are addicted to this game lack self-control over their own pursuing of pleasure.  I’ve seen it several times and I feel sorry for them.

I did at 0:14 :)
I’m going to give you actual advice that isn’t “everything is viable in low elo” I know you don’t care about what a bunch of immortal sweats have to say because I was in your shoes on league and it was the most frustrating response I heard while I was in bronze. So let me answer this question for you the way it should be answered (coming from an ascendant player not amazing at the game but still decent)

Play the character that fits your play style and how you envision to play the game at a high level. You are going to be (if you play the game enough) skilled enough to understand and apply any concept to the characters you play no matter how viable they are, metas are a very important thing to know understand and utilize but metas are more important for knowing what to expect and how to adapt to them more than how to abuse them. You are welcome to abuse metas and they are very good to abuse but know this. Your play style will not change much and you will always have a preference on how you want each game, round, and moment to go. That is what your character dictates, so play to the strength of your style and if you don’t know your style work on finding that and experiment to find what works for you. 


TLDR: stop trying to win start trying to improve. Find what you want to do in valorant and play to that, not statistical data. People made yoru work pre re work.. in radiant.. with >60% win rate.
genuinely never seen an average tracker score of 26 💀
I play dualists cause I stopped playing for an entire month. Within that Month I forgot setups and how to play KJ, Harbor, Viper, Brim, Omen, Astra, Sage, Sova, Skye, and Fade. 

I genuinely forgot it.

And since I can’t be bothered to re-learn them I just go Dualists. To be fair I do everything Dualists do. But I do missed carrying an entire team with KJ.
I mean they're iron bro. Not that it discounts their ace but it's funny to hear someone say that an iron player is trying to show off, if you're iron you should not have an ego to think about showing off lmao. Post lead with asking for advice. Doesn't matter if the clip is an ace you can see from that one round multiple things that they are doing wrong and should work on.

The biggest thing noobs don't realize is the different parts of your inventory and squad setup. I assume ul how heroes and defenders work in the game, but everything else can be easily misunderstood.

Schematics: All the selective Traps, Melees, and Guns that you CAN craft yourself. Also where you may modify perks and compare stats. 

Backpack/Storage: All of your acquired materials that are used to build structures and/or craft your schematics to use in-game. Storage is a backpack space that can not be accessed in-game except for your storm shield defenses.

Survivors: Basically, your power level designers. Each regular survivor is given a selective personality and squad bonus. The personality is to be matched to your lead survivor of a selective squad. Mythic lead survivors are your main priority of acquiring before worrying about your basic survivors because each mythic lead will have a specific squad they must be placed in, which will be noted in their character description.
ok i get wrong sub and all but lol what a genuine skill issue
I'm gonna beat those things to death with a doomhammer I hate what they do to my builds
There is no such things as "best sens".
As long as it's not crazy low or high its a good sens.
The only thing that is important : when you find a sens that suits you, DO NOT CHANGE IT.
Sometimes it will feel off but you need to persist.  If you change it every now and then, you will never learn it well and master it.

It's normal when you stop playing and come back that everything feel off but give it some time and you will see everything will go back to normal.

And btw this goes for crosshair, resolution, FOV and so on.
Yeah neon, jett, fade, deadlock, gekko, skye, and harbor all objectively deserve to get voted out before he does
just got invited, have 1 last code

lmk if u need 1, its for playstation.
I stand corrected then, I had no idea it was that bad
Well damn, his vods always looked nowhere near radiant. If you think about it, it's still shitty because 100 rr players are literal bots (me included) compared to rad.
Yeah I don’t think he’s overpowered b/c there’s a lot of ways to deal with him, I think he’s just not a fun addition to the game
I played all 10 160s and had zero issues with randoms in pubs. Where ya playing
You should learn how to convey information in a way that isn’t degrading, might help you out
It’s normal for people to laugh at a weird crosshair . Especially when you’re using crosshair like the flappy bird pipe or a horizontal straight line .
[removed]
My endurance also has this issue. Had a friend check and his is also having the same issue.
I’ve got so many skins now that I just leave it on random favourite skin. It’s weird because it usually chooses the same knife/gun combo, for example: one game I’ve got my champ butterfly and prime vandal, and the next game it may be the exact same. Happens more often then it should imo 🤔
welcome to valorant
This is the perfect explanation
that is incredibly high, i run 800dpi and 0.2 currently but as someone who also originally used a stupidly high sens (2400dpi and like 1.2) just slowly drop the sens bit by bit. after every death in a few unrateds or so until you get to around the 800dpi 0.5 mark. then go a bit lower but find whats comfortable for you
Aw thanks man :)
I’ll pass it along thanks
That's not for me to Adress your argument . You're making the statements you have the burden to prove what you're saying .

You literally have no idea what you're talking about .

You're point of fortnite using unreal and having a replay system therefore valorant can easily make one is the most stupid take I've read about the replay system.
Shortly after it first came out, when it only needed 3 energy per shot. It’s still good but since its not brokenly good i don’t use it as often
10000 itne mein russian aajaati
i dont understand some people not buying although they’re bottom. It’s okay to be bottomfrag, somebody got to be eventually anyway… What matters is whether they give useful info and cooperate. Not everyone is on their good game every game+it might be the round they get multiple kills and it wins you the game, who knows? (:
3/10 for the routine. I would guess that you are not the person that would want to aim train a lot and thats okay, but if you would still listen to my advice then here it goes...  


2 unrated for warming up for comp is a lot and will drain your mental, I would advise that you can stick to swiftplay or tdm to warm up for comp. Also, add more dms and try to aim train using moving targets in the range.
i started this year in march and was at bronze 1. for a day or 2 i went down to iron 3 but now i’m silver 2. this was my first multiplayer fps
Because in lower elos winning could be mainly due to luck rather than team play, which is the case in higher elos, hence why they dont value kills as much as you rank up higher
Sunset, split, and breeze. I run exclusively Sova/raze/Kayo on those 3 to counter cypher. It's such a boring meta

He probably doesn't mean it litteraly
The skill gap between silver and plat/diamond is just too huge for silver players to play consistently better to rank up. Sure they might get a few good games here and there but overall diamond level team would win more often than not.

You wouldn't learn boxing by being put in a ring against Mike Tyson and getting beaten to a bloody pulp. The same way silvers don't learn much by playing against diamons who outaim and outgamesense them.

Put silvers against gold players if you want them to prove themselves.
thank you man 🙏
Why does ISO have a bandaid under his eye
Nah, man
It's not Ur fault, latest rank G2 / the acts before to, and now after the huge loose streak I came come out from bronze, the play style in this elo is so confused , the other team members going every match afk, I want just to go back to normal players :(
Nice bro
I , a bronze, think diamond is a high rank. I’m now also sad seeing that gold is considered the average. I’ll be happy to hit silver one day lol.
Yep, works like a faster Fade/Breach ult, but stops at the first enemy
except with harbor
I'm pretty sure you need it for certain guns such as the Classic.
Tbf they don’t count missed shots in the calc, if you’ve spent a whole clip spraying someone but got the kill with a hs you’d still have a 100% hs. Also if you’re running around like an elephant and then have shitty movement around corners, you’re gonna get tapped. It’s literally not even hard if you have a little bit more than half a brain cell.
I agree with everything but not that he/she should forget and not think about technical stuff. Thats how people get hardstuck in Iron/Bronze with bad mechanical habits ingrained into their brain
Tell me about it. I’ve been waiting for glitchpop vandal in my shop since like season 1
You realise not everyone is well-to-do right? Some people can barely afford a smartphone let alone a PC
I just respond with "ok...."
Cus generally most people you play with or against are in your general skill area. (Save for the occasional diamond that's stuck down with you.
When someone is being toxic towards you, and then ADDS YOU TO TALK MORE SHIT. These people are so damn insecure they NEED to get the last word and feel that they overpowered a complete stranger. I'm always dumbfounded when i end a toxic match and the person adds me to talk more.
i dont play comp much because people take it way to serious for me to play with people until ive at least gotten better at crosshair placement and head level aim.
Also, there's actually a limit to how many husks can exist at any given time. Fun fact: Chrome husks take up multiple slots.
Once again, fuck you Riot for continually nerfing Viper
Sage shouldn't really be "backseated" She slows down punches and walls off and then she should take duels and play normally.

Smokers on the other hand like Astra, and brim needs to stay alive for smokes and have really team condinated abilites.
I hate Keeoh. The “agent to immortal” shit that he puts out is smurfing for content. Yes, other streamers do it too, but I’ve seen his the most.
Do you make the same comment on posts about new stw starter packs in the br item shop? Or stw player numbers in the br lobby? He's in the locker, what's the big deal?
Literally said it is not mine
In some of my first games I wanted to know what ability blinded me, so I was looking for the replay viewer. Like, I did not even question it would be there because the game feels so polished. It's a shame, really. OW is ahead in that department. The replay viewer is amazing.
If I want to grind I find a day I'm really feeling it and pump out games. No point in playing comp if I'm gonna do ass anyways, gotta think about the poor bastards who would need to deal with me going 2/17 as a instalock Reyna 🥴
L cant position on attack when having to move up to a bomb site full of rats. The characters need some agency
you would buy the agent if you wanted to play them right away just like it used to be
Im happy that you like it :)))  
Might change fandom from time to time :v
Might be my internet I'll try later
Any update?

>Because 20-30% of all players in online FPS games cheat nowadays. That was the reported findings of AnyBrain, a big new name in the anti-cheat industry that has worked with Valorant.

>Because of Eggwicks video where he interviews cheaters and similar sources, we know that cheaters can go months without being detected, and that is for the big, cheap and easily accessible cheats and not the more expensive and more limited once that only allow a finite players to have it so it won't get detected for a long time.  
>  
>Cheaters are in an abundance and far more cheat than what most people know. On average in a lobby of 10 players, chances are 2-3 of them are cheating. Of course there are certain ranks they are more likely to be in and in higher concentration. Which is the middle ranks for people that soft-cheat and are still bad: gold-diamond. And asc-immo for those that either use cheats more heavy handed or are already good and use cheats to further enhance their abilities.

>Among commonly used and hard to detect cheats are: triggerbots (both programs but also physical devices you connect to a PC), radars (Separate PC can show all players locations on map, unbannable due to running on separate computer), wallhacks and macros.

>I have played this game for 2k hours, peaked immortal, more or less stable ascendant player nowadays. Back in ep 3 when I got to immortal the anti-cheat actually worked. There were far few cheaters and the game seemed reasonable: Low ranks were bad, high ranks better. Nowadays there are so many cheaters it is harder for me to get out of diamond than it is to play in ascendant. In all my time in this game I only had confirmed 5 cheaters. Riot anti-cheat bans noone. with the fact of the matter being 20% cheat and you can play with thousands of people before one is banned, it tells the truth. Far more people cheat than what is being caught or reported by Riot.

I agree with you that shitty iso players are able to abuse iso right now solely because of the amount of time the shield is able to stay up. The up-time of the shield means they get to be very sloppy in the timing of when they choose to have a shield. If they can sharpen the timing to be similar to that of a jett dash I think it would be quite fair. 

The shell shock is likely the result of seeing the shield more often, and thus having to counter play it now, but I can recall pretty similar shell shock when cypher got buffed and we couldn’t all yolo into sites because the trip was more prevalent. We’ll adapt as we always do
Sorry you experienced that! Some boys’ prides just can’t handle the fact that a girl can perform just as well, if not outperform, them. There are a lot of decent people out in valo though.

If you ever wanna play, message me.
Ok
Nice molly
Fr just stop caring about the rank and have fun. Also if you went 0 kills in the second half that means you were to blame too. You're better than them sure, but you don't stop playing with people cause they suck at the game just have fun. Being a peak gold player means nothing, neither does ascendant or even immortal. It's a game
Blows my mind how RIOT lied so hard about making the most accurate FPS game ever... All the talk about peekers advantage and bullet accuracy.

I could tell from day 1 of beta that this game was broken, bullets just disppear, even the first shot from many guns are random and don't hit where you're aiming.

I'm not sure how people continue to play it, it frustrated the hell out of me.

I'm not saying CS:GO or CS2 are perfect, they also have huge issues with bullet reg, but Valorant is next level BS.

I wish it did live up to the hype that RIOT was pumping out pre-release, I'd be playing it right now.
To be honest, I don't understand why DTB hasn't been removed entirely. It's always been extremely buggy, it still uses placeholder assets from the Alpha, and it has now been excluded both from mission alerts and the 2 last zones we got.  


Not to sound like I'm complaining or being pessimistic, but it really would make much more sense to either remove it altogether or remake it internally from the ground up (With non placeholder assets at that).

The [challenge the horde skill tree](https://www.gameskinny.com/wp-content/uploads/gameskinnyc/0/o/d/0odhgjaoqaerlilcqy-saa-c64a6.jpg) was similar to the old Fortnite skill tree (the one they revamped), and maybe it depended on code from that old model.

Sure, but you'll come back only to ask if you should quit again. This is the eternal struggle of always hating a game you enjoy when you are fixated on rank.
I thought it comes with an infinite loop like the butterfly, but obviously not just a default inspect... there must be a mistake.

Sorry in advance for any quality issues, I'm playing on my laptop!
I'm on a peak to lose my wife
I once went from immo 2 to plat 3, I usually get my asc1 on placement but dw you'll go back to diamond in a week
Quick tips:
1. Get good sleep
2. Do an aim routine consistently every day, no miss days
3. Learn movement, especially those you can use in gunfights like good peeking, good strafing, etc.
4. Review your gameplay, start with mechanics first like aim, movement, and crosshair placement; then you can go to deeper topics with game sense with the help lf woohoojin videos
5. Keep watching valorant guides, even simple ones like where to plant spike
6. Have fun and find motivation to get out of low elo
Using Odin has proved useful for me in games that we play attack first. I usually use it on the last two rounds of the attack phase and whenever I can buy it in defence. When we're defence first I normally don't use Odin cuz it prompts the enemy to use it in their defence phase. Unless the score difference gets to 5! In that case it's odin no matter what.
As time goes on, the average player in a competitive game gets better. What may have been plat 2 years ago may be the equivalent of bronze in today’s game.

I feel like the ‘perfect’ agent pool for soloqueue is Brim/Omen, Skye/Sova, Jett/Reyna. Sova on Ascent/Bind/Haven is absolute freelo. Not all players are adept at playing off of initiators util, but sova dart is so simplistic that people don’t even need to pay attention to get value from it. You’re literally telling your team *exactly* where people are playing via the scans.
imo the whole ranking up by getting better gear is more of a mental boost. you feel you're gonna win more because you got a better monitor, mouse, or keyboard. but its not gonna make you magically go from gold to plat

Aiming for the head in every duel should be your number 1 priority and you will fly up the ranks 

Utility (outside of smokes) doesnt really matter until you hit the really high ranks
you're able to appeal
haha
Lol no
Huh, funny coincidence. Z is the last letter of the alphabet, hence my confusion.
Overrated:
- Kuronami Vandal: it sounds like i’m shooting legit paper plates, and the pullout animation is off-putting
- Reaver Karambit: I’ll never understand what people see in that knife, it’s the worst Karambit in the game
- Spectrum Classic: “Do do do do do-“. Shut up
- SOL Vandal: (Personal Opinion, that thing is a whiff machine)

Underrated:
- Protocol Phantom (mostly the skinline in general): I feel like people know it’s good, but i rarely see people using it.
I use this one personally:

I was just meaning did the person I was responding to have one. Thank you though, that should give me some more options when rechoosing my crosshairs
If you used to get 110 fps in val with this machine, but now you're getting 70fps with the same machine, try reinstalling Windows fresh. You've probably got a lot more bloat on your PC than you did 3 years ago.
Yeah he seems pretty decent into Jett as well.
I’m like 700+ peak S3. If you play like 8 hours a week trust me you won’t rank up that fast. If you want to then play everyday all day. Just do what feels best
I agree with the other comments, it never gets better. So many people just lose their minds if anything doesn't go their way. I see exactly what you mean but ranking up doesn't fix it.

I played a bunch of csgo back in the day (FaceIt lvl 8 etc) and bro I think it's just the toxic riot community man. League of legends is the exact same they lose lane, instant running it down. No fucking backbone. So yeah it's the game unfortunately, maybe someone makes like a FaceIt for Valo which would maybe make it better.
I didn’t get a friend request
what rank you are
Defo Ini and Smokes
As long as people keep whaling on CS they never will though, even if they did valve would probably sooner shut the servers down lol. valve is the LAZIEST company in gaming, I feel like no one else even comes close
oh thanks, I never heard anything about it so I assumed it never happened since STW news is few and far. It was caused by explosives/projectiles not having an "owner" dealing damage to objectives, and ownership of projectiles go away when you leave a game mid-shot, which is easily exploitable by weapons that stay in for a very long period of time like the Dragon's Fury. You could've destroyed any objective with a maxed out Fury by shooting 3 times then leaving as fast as possible!
**12. Wall spikes \[Absolutely essential\]**

I noticed a lot of people are sleeping on this trap. This is absolutely the trap you need to use for walls that husks wanna bash on, like those around the objective. Sure, there are cases you wanna put darts instead, but if you don't have the inverted ramp and floor launcher setup due to a tight space, the wall spikes are it. This is because it "reloads" incredibly fast which means it deals more DPS the faster the husks bash on it. I've seen a Plankerton smasha with full health die to it (in Endurance) before it could destroy the wall. This is probably not possible with a single wall dynamo, given how slow it reloads. Certainly not possible with a broadside shooting into the open air. 2x crit rating, 2x crit damage for the spikes because you don't need the extra durability (the wall will be destroyed by then lol).
I got to twine yesterday and am currently farming a 52 pure drop plankerton 23 lol. Gonna push my level up to get those juicy missions you speak of. 75 currently!
No. I started in Iron 3 and now am Ascendant 1. It’s all a matter of learning the game and finding confidence

No, likely Supercharged XP. They gave everyone Supercharged XP for seemingly no reason a couple of weeks ago, you probably still have some of that left.
I love the noc but people keep saying the bow and discharger lol
What can ya do, at the end of the day so long as there’s two characters left in the game, someone is gonna counter someone else
Vandal if you wanna learn how to take good gun fights and aren't great at it yet-- but vandal vs phantom is VERY situational depending on map/agent/w.e
Then start practicing aimlab, deathmatch, studying pro vods, you can't be addicted to improvement if all you do is play ranked.

Nah man. All broadsides. On each and every wall
Its not worth because it's better to just trade out your teammates than being the last player alive in low ranks. Low ranks overthink a lot when rushing a site works in 90% of the situations if you can just coordinate with your team properly. And lastly, if the Reyna is on the opposite side of the map their team is hitting, regardless of lurking or making noise, it's a bad play. Lurks should be primarily sentinels like cypher and kj or controllers who can drop long range smokes.

ok but AI noise cancelling exists
not swinging, peeking, if you know they're deathballing then swinging into 5 people is a bad idea, holding a tight angle, isolating a kill or two while they shoot your util before getting traded
Well, you are not supposed to play for the worst case scenario. You should be playing for the most likely scenario.

I agree with you that in the worst case scenario, that you get noticed with no way out, a duelist has better odds than a sentinel.

But the most likely scenario is you get a kill or initiate a gunfight that you can opt out of.

Trigger discipline comes into play when you manage such a deep lurk that you are guaranteed to meet at least two people from behind. In which case if you whiff then that's on you. They are not looking at you, a flash or a dash won't help you unless you again, expect to whiff and need to cover.
In matchmaking he is perfectly fine. The ability to take consecutive duels that would normally be 50/50 at like 80/20 is incredible. There’s not a lot that could be done to buff him without making him too strong on ladder (making his wall bigger is an example of a buff that would be okay). In pro play it’s obviously a much different story.
For the one in Canny, it's at the end of the Canny story quests.

The one in Twine requires you to be PL 122, completed Storm Shield Defense 5, and eliminated 3 minibosses in a 140 zone (for King Me, changes every week after first win)
he’s straight up stark naked wdym
But also an addition of 


Removed Mantling!!! Yay, time to clear the dust off the Guardian’s Will!
Fuck, you are right🤦
You have missed your chance for this one, these styles were available in chapter 4 season 1 battle pass.
Hmm I don't know cause I went from S2 peak to B1/2 in the hard reset so i don't think iron but let's just say you know when it's too easy and too hard. Like I'm sadly not ready for Gold cause I don't have aim consistency. But, I'm not fit for Iron or low Bronze sometimes cause their aim and/game sense is worse than mine. So I know Silver is where I should be right now. But, going up against G3s/Plats that hard reset lower is tough because that just means they improved and I didn't.  So it feels like smurfs but there's a difference between placement and rank "settling" imo.
If it makes you feel better i am competent and will insta lock for you.
Thank you for being so kind, I don't expect that online so it was a tiny surprise that made me feel ever so slightly better in real life. Hope you have a nice day :)

That’s fair enough. You can also use Mr Brightside to spam “I’m cumming” too. Each to their own, I just think they should have been three or four bucks each instead of five since their plan is to just make endless tracks in the store and so far their bundles and individual prices have been pretty meh
One rule I like playing with is if someone insta locks they don’t get to tell me how to play. I will lock in who I want, but whatever guns I want, do what I want (without throwing)

Unfortunately insta lockers are almost unavoidable but your best bet is to ignore them and play what you’re comfortable with
But maybe it is. If 40 percent of the player base are female how many of them decide to compete to go pro comparatively to men? Then you have a calculation to do of how many people competing to go pro are female compared to male and why ? I think the numbers don't go further than here because no one is questioning why
when is the server coming back up?
I thought I was the only one. I’ve had minima spectre in my shop 4 times and the Tethered Realm Operator 3 times.

It's not good. I was 100% part of the people who were glazing it when it was announced tho. 

It is awful. It takes roughly as much time to reload 1 bullet as it takes to fully reload 5 bullets on a marshal. A guardian or a bulldog is just better. It feels like a cheap gun that fills a niche, like the stinger, except it isn't cheap.

Big part is a mental debuff. Ghost shoots quicker so there's not as much pressure to be 100% accurate with every bullet. With a sheriff though, there's a good chance you die if you miss your first shot.

Yeah. Unfortunately if you’re on controller you can’t get pc perfomance mode

That depends. Are you aware that you're posting in the official *Save the World* subreddit, and are you a Founder of said game (purchased before Early Access ended on June 30th 2020)?

...or are you maybe a lost Battle Royale player?
Thank you!
You are right. I don't know why you're being down voted. I hate when valorant reduces the skill ceiling of agents to make them balanced.
did you get in habit of spraying body with guardian or smth? it should apply to vandal just fine if you just make sure you burst and strafe between shots rather than spraying
It isn't broken, people just don't want to play properly against it. If it was broken you'd see judge used constantly in pro play and comp, but you only see it used sometimes because of how situational it is. People just mald at what counters their ego swing.

How tf is Viper a non traditional controller? You could say Omen is but Viper's entire kit is literally controlling.
Did u get it by posting Videos or how?
She is not the best agent in the game lmao, the plat rank is showing
Breach is wayyyy more traumatic because your stood there and then bam a tall ginger dude gives you a concussion then launches you ten foot in the air, that’s way more traumatic than jet knives
you just wrong, its fine tho, keep coping.
Alright mate. Whatever floats ya boat I guess ;)
Well from your comments it just sounds like you don't like more than half of the game if you don't like the agents/abilities, but you don't want to have wasted the time you already put in, which I get. But it's a sunken cost fallacy, maybe step back and realize it's not so serious and play something else! Good luck bro.
One thing they could do is make everyone's tracker publicly available. I believe Siege and Fortnite have this feature but for some reason Valorant's lets you set it to private which probably 50% of players do.

Since I started checking trackers during a game when I suspect a smurf, honestly pretty often it's obvious they're just having a good game. Had a Clove yesterday that started out 9-0 and was playing like a god - looked at the last few games, all under a 1.0 KD. I was able to rule out smurfing quickly, she came back to earth and ended like 19-18 or something, and we won the game.

But when the tracker is private, I can't make that confirmation and the presence of a "smurf" frags the team's mental.

Also - this game is way too conservative with RR. It's like they desperately don't want people to rank up. I am gold 1 right now but have been plat mostly the past year or so. Played with a silver 5 stack over the weekend and absolutely dunked on kids - three straight Ws three straight match MVPs with like a 2.0 KD in those three games. I gained like 54RR combined, even though it was brutally obvious I didn't belong in that elo.

If the game gave out more RR for dominant performances, players would rank up faster which would fuck with smurfs pretty badly. Oh you're a bronze 3 Jett absolutely laying waste to a full team of golds? Up up up you go, quickly.

There's so much Riot could do to combat the issue, but they insist it's not an issue, it's not against TOS, and they haven't shown a single indication they give one shit about it.
I have around 2000games in total. 1900 of those are with sage...
I’m enjoying Cheap Pickle these days
Skins used to be “microtransaction” small amount of money to get a skin but now it turned into “macrotransactions”. Skins now cost $20 in most games and they are even making them more expensive by bundling them with another shitty item just to increase the prices to $30-35.  you cant just buy the individual skin and you have to buy the bundle to pay more.
I mean fair enough but still, we were calling each other pieces of sht or trash if we lost the knife fights with the occasional “oh no the woman’s left fck her up” (not me, we were in cue with a girl) so I assumed we were cool with some edgy dark humour.
Normal flash max duration is 1.75 secs. Clone flash max duration is 3.1 secs.
I'm bronze rn and peaked silver 1 and no,not really,most are pretty nice, it's just the few and far between, 

Now I can't really speak for you but I think it's better to not fight with them, if it gets really bad mute that teammate and put some music on hope this helps
Y’all use mousepads?
as far as i noticed, iso's current iteration has his shield timer RESET when ulting someone (if you only had a few seconds left before your shield expires, it will reset to full duration during ult, and yes, he keeps the shield in his ultimate)
Nah, one thing I really didn’t like about csgo
But maybe teasers no?
True and still even that won’t work most of the time because they hold the angle wrong so usually the smurf can easily pick off kills one by one.
As far a game sense goes. That is absolutely fair. I main Harbor and I can be streaky going for the best player by far on one side and getting steamrolled on another. Any advise for better consistency would be appreciated.
[deleted]
Harbor received a huge buff to cascade only to be viable as a secondary controller and not a strong one without a viper. His win rate is still dogshit despite the buffs as well.

I don't think it's fair to talk group gekko in with harbor because at least harbor found his place as a secondary controller. Gekko is still in the experimenting phase, with only a few teams running him which mostly end up in loss.

Ofc I could be wrong and Iso could be meta defining on his release, but it's from what I know about his kit and from the feedback I've gotten from pros that tell me otherwise.

Yeah man, I'm stuck in iron for a reason, but how do I learn and improve if I have to fight people who instantly one tap me? I don't want to play in a way that specifically counters this one smurf on the enemy team.
It should be like a code that lets you share it and you just send it to your friends

Exactly! I keep a solid 1.1 kd or so, which is okay but not impressive, but when I get a kill and then give a callout that leads to a round win, that’s when having my mic on is so worth it IMO despite my anxiety

Damn, I'm outside your "kids" age range. Never thought not being considered a kid by a stranger on the internet would hit so hard lmao. At least i'm not that distant from that age, yet...
Your movement & the way you peek will impact how easy it is to kill you. There’s also the factor of being predictable, such as peeking the same angle over and over, because your opponent will be more prepared.

[removed]
Thanks but i wanna clarify i dont get one tapped while jump peeking/jiggle peeking i meant i do those before i take fights and usually mix it up like jump peeking for info jiggle peek to bait their aim and wide swinging but i still get one tapped sometimes i even blind before peeking out but still somehow just get one tapped
I notice a lot of people in my games repeatedly jump peeking the same spot with a predictable rhythm.
Yes and they would be far more effective of a duelist on Jett with easy updraft/dash entry pathing. Hell I still get Razes who whiff nades on Cypher trips, they all think they're Jingg but can't hit a stationary piece of utility. Don't get me wrong a good Raze is a nightmare to play against, but you have to be good with the satchel movement.
Because then you have people going 20-2 like its comp. People are here to have fun and not try hard. Sure its annoying of they sit in spawn but if you want to play go spike rush or unrated. Those two modes you either have to play or afk wont hurt as much
ok thx

"The flip side of this is I like playing Raze because I can get advantages in practically every 1v1" So you too want to be a duelist main, lol you ask a question where you already have the answer. 

It's more fun basically, that's it. And some people want to just practice their duels which isn't a bad strat to improve fast in low elo.

I get Epic wanting people to actually play instead of just logging in, but this is not the way to do it.  If they want people to play StW they need to invest in it.  Fix the bugs, finish the story line, regular updates and last but by no means least promote it.  They desperately need to do Twine Peaks properly, this could be one of many expansions, make it a free expansion as it should be then offer premium expansions after.  Have Twine finish at PL100 and then each expansion contains new themed heroes and matching schematics take us up to PL160 and beyond.

> my aim is decent and I play my role near perfectly

Thats your main problem. I dont even need to look at your tracker or ingame footage to tell you that your aim/movement/gamesense is bad and you dont play your role perfectly. Otherwise you wouldnt be bronze3.

I see alot people on this sub that totally overestimate themselves and that this is the main reason they cant climb. If you are under dia you have probably bad mechanics no matter how good your gameknowledge is. Thats the hard truth people dont like to hear. You are bad and that is the only reason you are at a low rank. If you understand this you will changes things and climbing will feel easy.
Just anyone who plays both modes. It’s be more of an inconvenience swapping back and forth and people would be less likely to do it.
low elo is rough, i spent a few weeks grinding out with majority of the players muted and made it back to my peak in plat , close to a new peak and everyone (for the most part) has been kind, rule of thumb, mute & report mute & report
U play sage bro , ofc ur bad
If they were listening it wouldn’t matter if we ended up using it or not. They’ve addressed the issue after 4 years by saying only that we hear you. 4 years is more than enough time to get something done even as a side-project.
Ignorant is bliss. That's like saying you used a trainer in a single player game and deserved to be banned online. It doesn't work like that. If you're a car thief odds are you're a criminal, you can't compare something LEGAL to something ILLEGAL and say it's the same. Game companies have zero authority to take away your account based on what you do on your own time, that's discrimination by law; even if they "don't like what you're doing." Doesn't matter at all what their Terms of Service says. This really opens my eyes about how terrible the community really is when it comes down to it, I genuinely don't feel bad for any of you that run into actual cheaters on a daily.
True... Every fuking time when we pull out a util, a player will peak and kill us.
I wonder if they'll add "ghost indicators" like they do for Morde and his Ult target in League.

That is incorrect. The chance of picking one gun out of five different guns is 0.2. The chance of getting that gun from the same pool again is 0.2 x 0.2 = 0.04. Repeating this math till we have drawn the same weapon 6 times from the pool of five we have 0.000064 or 1/15,625. I have no idea what you are doing here but it's not correct
Alot of players examine their usefulness by looking at their kda.. in reality you can be useful without being top frag. Also being able to realize when your not the main character of the match and should just try to help your teammates who are feeling it.
Basically. You'd be surprised how effective this is.

so if its useless why do u even care, new agents come out less often then before, theres a 4 week period for unlocking the agent  just by grinding xp and playing any game modes

10K is a cap for a reason, if u play regularly u can buy everything every week...its aimed for players that play a lot if u log only for half an hour every day then dont expect to get anything 

im sry but thats how it is, riot wants u to log in every day and play more...if u dont wanna do that u dont have to and u are not gonna be losing anything

i get ops situation, you wanna play with your friend but if they can't even play 1 good game while you're smurfing then you should be playing unrated
I'm still new so i haven't tried most agents yet but i play mainly deadlock or killjoy.

Their type of area denial and info gathering i think is superfun. The whole meta game you can play with Deadlocks walls to cut of flanks when you learn how the enemies play i love
We play it for competition

I like sandbox and competitive games

Sandbox to chill. Competitive to sweat, train, grind and improve.

I can enjoy competitive games for much longer because I can train things and improve on them, sandbox games are like time limited until it's just repetitive.

Unrated doesn’t have a skill gab or a MMR so it doesn’t really matter who you’re playing against. But it’s better for you to play against better players so you can improve faster if that’s your goal.

First get over the idea that kills mean everything. Kills don’t mean shit in 90% of games. 

Sure, you might have 30 kills but if your teammate has 25 assists then guess what? You most likely only got that many kills because of them. 

Your mental sounds very weak and I recommend you take a break while you sort it out.
do you know how close the enemy has to be to my trip before detecting it?

I don’t think so, thumb buttons are usually designed to be out of the way of a resting grip, so you change your grip to hit the button but doing that while aiming when you primarily aim/aim train with a resting thumb position will def mess with people

Tbh, the composite skins were the only ones from the last battle pass that I wasn't fond of. Like, they definitely feel like they stand out more than the blush and the digihex skins, but I just can't get into the gold color scheme. The digihex and blush skins both kick ass, though. Minimalist but colorful. I love it.

I have an Alienware 1440p 280hz monitor and I love it. Got it on sale for like 600 or 700 but I can’t remember the model name/number. I didn’t have much hope for Alienware brand tbh at first but it’s way better than the Samsung G7 that I returned before this one. 1440p is super nice for Valorant at high refresh rates
do you have any more to give?
I think your post is not a good take. 
You under estimate the power of boosted players.

Having a teammate who’s having a bad match is like a coin flip, but having a boosted teammate is more like flipping the coin but expecting it drop and stay sideways.

You know it will never happen. When you realize this your game turns into a practice (could also be argued as a waste of time).

That’s why you avoid solo q to minimize inconsistencies like these. Afterwards you can focus on YOUR inconsistencies, and eventually rank up.

I stand corrected then.
You aren’t peeking holding or sitting in the right corners if you can’t even win a single gunfight lmao.
You’re contradicting what riot devs have actually said on this sub, so please show proof or you’re just talking out your ass.
Well, you should care. Same as once women's rights were being "shoved down peoples throats" right?
I got into fps gaming when i was almost 33. Now when im close to 40, im getting decent with my aim and decision making. I would be mad if i got that much people ruining my games with their mentality, when i already need to close a gap to younger players. 
Call of Duty teaches you how to use real firearms in the same sense that watching Gray's Anatomy teaches you how to perform open heart surgery.

In a broader sense, Valorant can help enhancing cognitive skills (e.g.problem-solving/ reasoning), improved hand-eye coordination, and better teamwork/communication skills to name a few. It also rewards players for strategic thinking, multitasking, and emotional regulation (e.g. NOT TILTING).
Yes. There's no good reason to do this. Better to just trap every wall and climb in from one tile high instead since wall climbing is a thing nowadays.
Same. Lowkey the most fun I ever had in the game was in no-comm silver lobbies, playing pre-nerf Astra and using only the map and my teammates' positions to place my stars correctly. It was like my own little rts game
It’s normal to do worse in higher lobbies than lower ones. I’m not sure what you’re looking to hear. 

If you don’t think it’s mental then it’s probably time to work on your weaknesses to improve 
By not getting killed
Yea, I just fight with them now. Usually, if I stand my ground they stop. I know that sounds horrible, but that’s what happened to me when I’d talk shit as a kid. Then I’d stop. Not to mention most people who play games don’t like speakers so they’ll yell at them too. My suggestion to you in all honesty is immediately mute them if they’re toxic and don’t deal with it.

It happens enough that it's completely understandable but also why did mobile get its own? At that point why isn't there one for consoles specifically too... Or Playstation since they like being separate lol
Assuming you've got a phantom/vandal, aim for the head. The second bullet of either gun is still accurate and will kill. Part of this is mental because people think they've got to break shield and then shoot iso (two steps) instead of doing it all at once.

Alternatively, you can jump spot through the initial wall with a classic or shorty to break the shield and then treat it as a normal 1v1.
I see what you mean but there are multiple skins that are reloaded by force Fielding a sphere into the side of the gun etc. There are plenty more stupid.
Yeah it does that. Gotta either find the group (machine pistols, heavy auto SMGs, typewriter, etc)that is a slightly different shade and reslot everything in it or reslot all of them.
how to get this page
What if it was used with vacuum tube bow against water? Is that its place?
What's crazy is how much more accurate it used to be at run and gun before the nerfs
Yes it was definitely worth it. Save the World is a really fun game once you start progressing and playing it more.
Yes

last two matches i used comms the players were some mix of homophobic, misogynistic, or racist. not worth cussing them out and reporting. rather just play solo
Id be so grateful for a ps5 EU code❤️
bring back mtl
You were my twin as well for a long time, but felt it was to "jittery" so Im down to 0.29 now
There’s no bind but if you are quick enough you can switch it in the menu
It's pretty simple, really. On Breeze, half the agents are useless or unusable. The map is so defense sided. The moment someone on defense whips out an OP, it is already over. Damn near every gun fight is from like 50m away. You'll get those teammates who just drag you down by a mile. Icebox might be bad, but if the whole community took a survey to permanently delete either Icebox or Breeze, it will be Breeze 10 times outta 10.
Nah bro, skins don't make you better. It's all in your head. But hey, if it makes you feel like a pro then go for it. Just remember to actually practice though.
Send it in a month? Yeah that’s a “fuck off” timeline.

Likely the data they’ll send it about matches, rank, picks, win/loss. Their data on clicks and engagement is probably more confidential since I’m guessing they dont want people to know how much is being measured.

Three duelists, one with flashes, one smoker and one sentinel, I can take it tbh
Problem is (for me at least) my aim is actually really good when I’m not stressing or trying too hard. But as soon as I get anxious or start doubting myself or try to ‘force it’ my aim goes out the window

So personally the only way I can keep my aim consistent is by not allowing myself to experience those things. Only way to do this is get comfortable enough in comp where nothing really phases you. It’s still a work in process for me lol
You lucky mf… I just came back to Valo after a year or two of not playing and have spent the last 2 weeks praying for the kuronami vandal every night before I go to bed
Code plss
Only reason I want cypher out of meta is so that deadlock can maybe get a rework and shine
if you scroll through all processes in windows, you will find a riot client app running in the background. end this process and uninstall val. or boot into safe mode 
I play most games infinitely better in the early morning, maybe it’s a personality thing. Or you just all aim no brain.
U can swipe multiple times, also valorant isnt a game where u have to 180/360 nonstop. Idk u wanted advice take it or not idm

No, it was Battle of Plank Harbor.

I don't know if it was bugged or not but the last time I did it, it did not count.
i started playing val with the console release but i felt this in my soul. 2 days ago i was cooking and top fragging but yesterday for half the games it felt like i forgot how to play first person shooters and i was bottom fragging lol. its crazy
going through this right now, my account is linked to my xbox so luckily im able to log in on rocket league and fortnite to get the account id too, since its linked im able to see the reciepts where i bought the little skin packs on fort. along with providing i own the xbox account. if this doesn't get me my account back then i'll kepe trying or start calling them.

Seriously? Like is it so hard to just hit “no fill” and get every husks to yourself? Dude could have at least typed in the chat or used a mic to ask for this player to ease up a bit.
1. Sticking to playing a particular agent(Raze) without considering the requirements of the map.

2.Satcheling here and there without considering the surroundings.

3. Not checking the most basic corners while entering the site.

4. Expecting us to enter the side as fast as he does because he is a duelist, and when we try to follow him, we die because he didn’t clear all the corners even after entering first.

5. Not closing the doors on ascent after entering the site.

6. Not covering me when I am planting the spike.

7. Constantly giving calls of enemies when I can clearly see them in the mini map.

8. Constant advice during clutch situations.

9. Taking over plans before a site hit, causing us to change everything a few moments before the round starts.

10. Jiggle picking as if it’s PUBG, and playing on extremely low sensitivity just because VCT pros do it, making it difficult to check multiple angles quickly.

I can keep going on I swear…..
Send the vod
"Cypher/Omen main", damn you're me. Though I do play a bit of Skye, when the rest of my team doesn't already consists of a mix of duelists and initiators. So not that often.
Ok
That's the idea. 

The easiest way for a good CS player to reach a high rank in Valorant is baiting their team. It's strictly winning, it's just not very nice.

I guess it depends. If the kills you are getting are impactful, maybe. I'd rather have a Deadlock that gets 1 kill but delays a rush and waits for us to retake than having a baiting and lurking Reyna that gets 3 kills after everyone else dies.    
And since the game is a tactical shooter, you need to hold your own weight to a point. Bottom fragging is fine, but there's a difference between going 12/17 to 3/16.    


\>or will it backfire once i get higher in ranks?    


It will. Players in higher ranks will have better aim and gamesense, it'll get harder and harder for you to make an impact if you lose every gun duel.
lmao 😭😭
Another post on this subredit said that it's currently ~26GB, but will become ~40GB like on PC after the full release.
Me plz
None of the points you make prove why riot should care from a business making profit standpoint.
What issue happened? the game is in English (dialogues only) but all my settings are French 

What platform are you playing on? ps5

What happened prior to seeing the issue? I went from ps4 to ps5

Do you have a link to video/screenshots depicting the issue? yes if necessary
you are right, i do often blur the lines in my head even knowing that about coordination

i corrected myself in a later comment after doing bare minimum research and saw he’s still overall one of the highest picked agents
If you're in comp and you get 3 instant lock duelist, just do whatever you want and mute them. More than likely they'll be bottom fraggin and or trying to hold flank with Reyna. Even better they'll instant die on defense cuz they want to push. If they really are doing that, report them for feeding and smurfing. 

It makes those games more enjoyable when they won't ff. When ibtry to play a filler role, I usually end up being the last one alive after 15 seconds
 You can really make the game drag out for them too. :)
Honestly just play whoever you’re comfortable with. Learn some agents in spike rush and unrated. I swear u don’t even get normal comms and teamwork until plat, let alone team-balancing. Dw about what others pick for now just learn the ropes.
How long does the beta last?
Cuz ur flatout wrong.
PWO is the hardest but I always use the go gnome banner icon
Nice! It seems like the kunai is a bit too big though
It only works with outlander in the lead
Literally case and point of why they say it. You did a whole blogpost on Reddit which I didn’t read btw.
If your data is accurate, it matches what the eye test says.

To get out of Iron-Silver (it feels like), you gotta be utterly dominant.

It's the wild west down there.
I personally take spike since I play in stacks a lot. I'm just used to it xD especially since I mainly play sage, brim or skye. 

And if I notice someone always gets the spike and then instantly dies, every round, then I also take it.

I think most people just dont want the responsibility of planting. You cant shoot or use abilities when planting. You gotta trust your team protecting you
Not sure why you got downvoted. Logically that would make sense to me. If she gets fully rezzed by getting a kill/assist I don't see why enemies wouldn't get an orb for killing her.

They probably didn't think about it during play testing or it was too much of an edge case scenario to resolve.
Ok thanks 😀
probably would be better to put raw numbers in gun economy tbh. expand the rotating (defense) part like "don't scream IT'S BBBBBBBBBBB" when you see a flash, tell your teammates how many players you saw. one player should be staying on the other site while 4 (or how many are alive still) are checking the possibly attacked site"
Yea cuz people barely strafe in bronze
Nothing better than sucking with your friends
Forsaken also came out *after* the original sovereign bundle, which had ghost stinger guardian and marshall.

Forsaken is essentially a flawed sovereign. I don't think there is any gun overlap and would be surprised if they ever did.
Valorant tracker combines ur stats to give you a score between 0-1000 which says vaguely how good you are, it isn't an amazing metric though
...no it doesn't? I literally helped my sister-in-law set up the game for the first time last week, no such screen ever appeared. It also never once appeared on either of my accounts.

Not sure where you thought you saw that? It seems like maybe you just have an overactive imagination?
Dude did you not read his post he said the idiots there to help him were actually killing the survivors FFS read the post before assuming
Lol maybe you should lead the title with, i was top player in tf2, my first clip.
Well, I’d check into their trackers and see if your trios’ win rates are lower than yours, and if they are, I’d recommend considering no longer playing with them.
And someone who has 32 kp is less impactful than someone with only 21? I don't think so.
Search on YouTube "woohoojin this will get you to gold"
One of my friends is also gold he was playing  with us in high Play - low diamond lobby and performed well enough and he got +23 in a draw

Weirdos. Some people will join a lobby and immediately start belting out slurs or saying weird crazy shit to get a reaction out of faceless teammates and its incredibly annoying.

I wish there was a sort of honor system in the game similar to how OW or LoL that gave decent enough rewards for people who are baseline levels of normal.
because you only harvest materials with melee.
What are the problems with the changes? They all seem pretty good for a pre-season patch with understandable rationalizations
Of course there's a new llama when you I'm away from home
Nah 45mins to 1h is the sweet spot for comp.

With shorter games people give up even quicker too. Was an issue with league during the early game meta, games being decided in the first 5 minutes meant people trolling and leaving so they could get into the next game. Longer games mean more balance and chances for come backs.
it wouldn’t change at all, since the thing actually accepting the inputs and relaying them is the OS. There might be like 2 or 3 milliseconds of delay gained by being in borderless compared to full screen. But that’s 100x faster than tenz reaction time. It’s just placebo
Sentinel looks cool that's the only one i dont have on the list.
Cypher: You don't always need to have anti-exec trips. Sometimes you can play with info trips. Especially helpful on 3-site maps like Haven and Lotus.

Astra: Golden border shows you the radius of the star. Reclaim smokes for mind games. Always have map awareness so you don't get jumped in Astral form. Ult wall blocks sound, so get silly with it. If an Astra ults for you on a retake, that usually means "someone stick that defuse" because enemies can't hear it.

Sova: Drone max height is based on the nearest surface that's under it. Use boxes and walls and ledges to get it extra high if you need.

Harbor: you can adjust the wall speed depending on how "directly ahead" you look. Head level makes it go the fastest and also the furthest distance. For more precise walls, you can look towards the sky or floor and the deployment thingy will go slower. Shorter max wall length, though, since the wall deployment is on a timer and not a set distance.
For a beginner, this sensitivity might be too difficult to control. Try using a slightly higher sensitivity.
Yea, I guess I should lay back and let them be next time. C:

A lot of times I go in and go straight to build defense, then I go to farm. One main reason is I don’t want people see a outlander and be like ah he’s not going to help, second is I just like to help with objective if I get the chance. Most people I play with are fine, but recently there’re some people just grief (I don’t like to use the word grief but I have no other word to describe their actions) my tunnels and my turrets. It’s not that my teddy and turrets are big deals, but seeing they get blocked constantly frustrates me, and a working tunnel should never be sabotaged by anyone.

Also I get it I can play in private, and I actually do, but I just can’t enjoy playing the game solo all the time.
No, just learn the game. You're actively ruining your chances to become better by trying to not just learn the Vandal/Phantom.
cypher trips aren’t that op, i saw a raze lineups video that destroys almost all possible trips on split, besides theres sova, raze, yoru, jett, omen, skye, fade and more that can destroy or help destroy the trips
gold. i’m peak plat2 and have finally gotten back but when the hard reset hit i got placed silver 2, was iut of silver in like a day and a half BUT i was in gold for the rest of that act and the beginning of this act, got to plat1 and kinda sped through it but did go up and down through gold3/plat1 gold is hell✋ too many people throwing, smurfing, trolling, ect
My preference araxy as i already got Kuronami, I did not like it though
they changed the game to be better for controllers. People are having fun so why change anything
If smokes or 1 hp heal from Skye count as an assist, then breaking Iso's shield should definitely count as an assist.
Aaa thanks
I feel you. I don't get mad on this game, but the closest I can be to getting mad is having my whole team peak the operator 1 by 1 and very slowly, so they make sure the sniper can shoot again by the time they are peeking.
Looks like it's fixed now. All 160s have alerts now, at least in my game.
Yes of course. Why wouldnt they lmfao
I know it will be different because we can just buy weapons, the point is that as i said some people like spike rush or play it to practice abilities which is better than in swift. I should have to switch game modes because of a single unfair agent, whats the point of having different game modes if the best thing to do is switch
Yeah why
they removed the ability to purchase lamas with vbucks a while back and changed it so that it no longer uses vbucks to unslot, instead it uses legendary flux. you still earn xray tickets alongside vbucks if you are a founder and can use those to purchase lamas. so yes vbucks are mainly for cosmetic stuff in the item shop.
Maybe with all the new modes they’re advertising Save the World is being moved to the menu they’ll be on instead of buried under a bunch of creative maps if you don’t have it favourited.
Ping. 100%.
Supposedly a new event questline is coming
Wait could I post this if I just remove the tracker links?
i cann share whit you wenn I recive one
i think this is a cosmetic problem, not a schematic problem
Hey you said that a guardian with sfx is on the works. I've been waiting since then. Could you give any updates plz🙏🏽
Take. Your. Time. 

If you shoot instantly but miss the first 3 shots 50% of the time you're going to lose a lot of fights. 

If you take your time and confirm your crosshair is actually on them and hit your first shots, you'll win a ton more duels. 

Woohoojin Gunfight Hygeine. Check it out.
Try using a vandal or phantom
A ssd is Your base which you Load up in and have to protect and then you get attacked. A ssd is the first mission you do in save the world
So every game I go in I try to communicate as much as possible but I understand your point. And I think a big problem of mine is that when I die I get frustrated really quick and my moral goes down so I definitely need to work on that. And I tend to get nervous really quick. 

Thank you for your response!
thank you!!

Singularity Phantom, I was so eagerly waiting for that skin to come into my shop and was so fascinated with the looks and animation
But when I eventually bought it I got bored within few days 
Not sure about it but that phantom feels like it has hell lot of recoil

Remove Breeze and add Haven would be the best map rotation possible
i'm good at breeze and have highest win rate  
but it's still most boring map for me anyway
Depends on who you ask. But to me, yeah
I think I got 14 once
There is truth in it. Reaching a peak vs luck vs consistently remaining at said peak is completely different but it can go both ways. Time\*Effort+Talent=Result, it just comes down to what you mean by "skill"? Shroud is mechanically gifted to pick up any FPS game and play it at the highest level so in that sense is he skilled? Or is he a grinder in other games? I think in this circumstance you'd exchange 'Skill' for 'Talent' and add it to the equation.
sage usually gets the spike, thats why they throw it to you. 

duelists dont take it cause theyre the ones to enter first. if they die with the spike alone the enemy could just camp one site.   
initiators sometimes get the spike too, but theyre too busy helping the push to plant.   
sentinel lurk a lot so they dont get the spike. *except* for sage since shes support and not a lurker, it makes sense that she gets the spike. she needs to play with her team anyways and isnt too busy with her kit.

if you have trouble with getting shot from behind maybe change the minimap to be set instead of rotating. it becomes very clear from where enemies can come at you.

also theres default plants on every map that are usually the safest places to plant, just look them up or look where others plant.

another good way to learn is to watch someone else play. maybe the enemy sage does something you dont or just look up gameplay online.
you backtracked from your original statement

Save the world updates totally get tested
Nah that’s not disrespectful, you’re right usually the lowest rank in my lobbies is asc2 and the highest being imm3. I’ve only had a couple games with a radiant in it and that was last act when I was imm1 before the reset.


I’d lose my shit if I saw a plat in my game haha
Nothing that I dislike about it, it's definitely one of my best ones, idk got like nine bought ones or so.
I just like the drag that the RGX knife creates, just looks very smooth.
Heaven and hell are similar words lmao what 😭 they don’t mean the same thing why would you think that. If I say “they’re ___” the words “Heaven” and “Hell” are interchangeable in that blank.
Cryostasis vandal is the best vandal and it’s not even close
You can do whatever the fuck you want with your money. All the 15 year olds here telling you how to spend your money is the most hilarious shit.
It is, but you will have to contact epic through their website and also I advise to not say anything about your friends account because it's technically against the ToS.
people already answered the “baiting vs trading” thing, but to answer what you’re talking about, just comm it! tell them to play a little slower on A main and that they should hit the site as you get the first blood, if they asked you to go with them and insisted, just go with them. if it works it works and you won, and if it doesnt *THEN* you can tell them let me try something different
Literally no one cares about your poopoo diaper rant.
I wouldn't say it is ddos if only you are spared from the attack. It could be your teammates were playing from same area/isp and it went down.
Opponent team didn't have all the money for a full buy so probably they did an eco mid rush.
I buy skins in order to play them in save the world. I don't even play battle royale. I felt this was just as relevant for save the world.
This is why soloQ is hard, if you want to climb easily just duo/trio.

SoloQ really test your mental eh :), either it breaks you or makes you become a 1v9 God.
When did they do the last updates for game last i played over a year ago it became boring
Haha true. I'm not a proponent of doing that BTW; just trying to make a point that it's pretty hard to fight toxicity when anonimity is at play and there are no real life repercussions for your actions.
Thanks, it’s not taking any emails I use. Not sure why.
I'm not white knighting jack shit,  I just want people to actually justify the things they're saying. Too many people would rather be "right" than be correct.

Trust me, I have zero respect for people who just go stomp Irons to feel better about themselves. If that's actually the case, then I'll resume my lack of care for him saying that the true elos of the people he's facing on the climb are accurate.
If you only died twice that game in THE 21 ROUNDS. You’re the problem stop baiting your team and start creating opportunities or taking space for them so it’s easier for them to back you up.
People hate saving. I even see people buy no armor to be able to afford a vandal
Of course man. I appreciate it. If I somehow manage to get my hand on another code I’ll send it your way
Names Amp, he is Chinese, and an initiator he can hear silent steps through walls if they are close with his free ability when he pulls this device out he doesn’t have weapon equipped it last 10 seconds before overheating for 30 seconds, he has a sticky grenade, and a can send out a miniature version of him self that will run like a yoru clone and if it spots someone it stops and points in there direction. His ult is an overcharge of his free ability that last 10 seconds and covers the radius of the map.
This is Godzilla
That’s an added benefit
This dosent even make sense. You pay credit to get the agent not get credits for getting the agent. The 2000kc is most likly bad filler text from the work on the new system.
I've become an Outlaw one-trick, I often prefer it over Vandal/Phantom because my reaction time/muscle memory sucks so I almost always use direct 1v1's, but at range and even CQB the one-tap potential is great, always make the enemy scared to buy light armor and if they get some chip damage I one-tap regardless - haven't bought a Guardian for a long time since Outlaw released, but when I recently bought one again I also did really well with it

Why do u care so much?
I would shamelessly say it, but if it was an NA issue, your post would have hundreds of upvotes, not zero.



Rito is leaning towards the NA. NA uses credit card, paypal, coupon, not UPI. And those are the ones you find. Also, the prices are based on $, not rupee. So as the difference grows, the prices reflect.


Also, Rito, why does NA have the update quicker than APAC or EU? Despite the latter being ahead in the timezones as well?

You can ahoot the small orbs to delete segments and still shoot through the wall unlike with sage who blocks vision and space. And since her wall is basically made of triangles if it's thrown badly you can still push out a little bit
Luckily for OP, deciding to break up a crossfire with a jump peek or util does not constitute as "great/amazing gamesense", it's just common sense for anyone above gold.

Post said great mechanics or great gamesense, not pick one and lose the other entirely.
No problem! Hope you get something good :)
Okay I will try to do that. I have a bad habit of just sort of freezing into place when I see an enemy. It just feels like I won't have enough time to strafe and  stop twice in the span of seeing the enemy and then dying or getting the kill

It's per individual based. If you win a game and perform better than higher MMR players on the other team, your MMR increases, but you can also lose MMR even if you lose a game if you perform worse than lower MMR players. 

You can be silver and have the MMR of a diamond player. 
That's why when you are on a win streak the game puts you against players that are very good, to see if you can actually handle that rank or not, if you don't, your MMR adjusts back.
You missed the point. Your reading comprehension is questionable
Cute
Thanks for the detailed answer! I get that these agents are popular, but my question is really how did Riot not release a fun/popular/alwaysmeta(like Sova or Jett) agent in the last years? 

I just cant believe that Raze, Sova or Jett are the Yasuos or Genjis of Valorant.
I played earlier everybody disconnected and we won and robbed the other team of RR
Some lobbies have a good vibe with people talking and really trying to win. Other times, people seem to just play for fun or worse, are playing in a pessimistic way because someone is toxic. People aren't going to try to hard to win when they're angry.
Jett + breach is really strong.
A little over 10K, i was on day 2138.

Looks like i spend quite a lot on skins.
I suggest trying out Raze one day, maybe even possibly Breach! Just try to branch out with Agents and see who all you like!:))
Ok, I’m probably not gonna be on for that much longer, but if I’m not on when your ready I can do it tomorrow 👍

Hope you feel better btw
Isn't it better than a $20 skin? Those are just as reproducible and at least this provides real gameplay.
Her role is to tank all the nerfs for other agents when she is perfectly balanced and enjoyable in the meta because the map rotation is ginormous is size. Rip my fracture girly
I was going to say "you can't ego swing players who will ego swing you back," but your answer makes more logical sense.

I am instalocking Deadlock to dodge Breeze
the fact u consider that a joke is intresting
Sage and Viper in my opinion
Yeah but us low elos don’t think about shit like that.
Because the generated frames may not necessarily line up with your monitors refresh rate. This is where g/free sync comes in which does make them match, typically with less of the downsides as vsync. 

Vsync matches your fps to your refresh rate, while g/freesync match your monitors refresh rate to your fps. But of course, these features are only available on monitors that support them.
Controller plays work when your team bothers to help you out with them.  Essentially, LMAO, good luck in lower elo
Damn snake is that a new haircut?
Eh I’m a HUGE minimap guy I hate not seeing the other site. Prob bc I was maining astra but either way

You purchasing the katana and maybe a couple hundred $$$ more worth of skins over the years vs The whale that spends $500 buying and fully upgrading bundles every month.

Your money is quite literally a drop in the ocean for riot.
Unfortunately, it never ends. From the bottom all the way to the top, there's a chance someone will just be in the mood to throw or be a jerk.
Imma have to try human bench mark. I’ve never even heard of it. I will report back when I’m done lol
You don't need a 1000 dollar phone to play a decent FPS. That I believe was mostly behind the success of mobile fps like pubg and freefire.
Nah, you just gotta watch videos and stuff to help you get good
There will be a better opportunity to get her, don't waste 1k on her
Yes, over the years the deliver the bomb bug has been an issue. It is as you describe, the bomb won't move and husks won't spawn. Also, another bug causing propane tanks being able to damage the launcher through the defensive structure at times. After running into so many bugs with deliver the bomb, I usually avoid them along with Category 4 storms. Category 4's have an issue of auto kicking players at random (at least in my experience) so I usually avoid those two mission types.
my best game was when i uninstalled this game and my worst game was when i initially installed this.
Its one of my favorite skins and i never got it on the store

Not that ACS really matters or that you should worry about it, but 200 seems about average. I'd expect a little higher from a duelist and maybe a little lower from a controller.
Voodoo ☠️
It was like playing a different game, i hated it at first lol

Also i did mean team fortress but we can still be brothers right? 🥹
if i could get a code that would be lovely 🫶🏻
1 game in and you are complaining lmao.
consider that not everyone is on pc. consider the fact that if 1000 people take the survey, thats 2000k clicks. or multiply the clicks on the ppl that take the survey.

its just that u rly should do it somewhat properly if ur asking people to take a survey. this shouldnt be on them, it should be done by u. obv whatever takes the community just a couple seconds can take the individual hours. thats just how crowdsourcing works.

its rly just about proper etiquette than anything tho.
Time, I don’t have enough of it to invest the hours I’d want and need to in order to rank up

Same. It felt a bit dramatized. 8 minutes of sappy music and him narrating certain parts too performatively. Getting up at 7am 3 hours before stream for mental heath and practicing mindfulness and wellfullness?

 Dudes acting like he got caught yelling racist stuff towards a dying dog or something. Ain’t that big a deal. Just say “my bad. I let it get out of hand. If you feel you were duped, feel free to unsub”.

it's pretty fun, i think? it's just that it's hard to control and it has too many openings. as a controller main (mainly clove and viper) the map is too big for clove's smoke and the high and low windows/openings are suddenly so big because viper's screen seemed to be too short on height.

should I try head height or slightly above neck because of recoil?
You are no higher than plat with this mindset considering how much of an impact a good chamber can have is way more than a good cypher or kj

Yoru. Gatecrash is extremely useful.
0.3 800dpi is my Sens and sometimes it feels too fast
No I was just saying that they're fine in plankerton as a counter to me saying they're useless
Stop caring
Honestly, I don't even know what sensitivity is, I just know dpi and play on 3800 dpi, getting good kda with it never getting less than 15 kills(unless I'm having one of those bad days) anybody tell me what it is so I know?
Slide the tracker NOW
Awesome ! Except im not in VCT and the current pool needs ascent/bind removed at the very least.

Ascent has been involved since released and bind is just really poor map design.

Icebox/breeze just got their main smoker cut off at their legs.

Cypher just got a big split nerf for his a/b high cams.
Um Conan exiles, 7 days to die, ark, oxygen not included, Minecraft, satisfactory, borderlands 2, deep rock galactic, vermintide 2 and I'm sure I have others but these I still play regularly.


Also the game was definitely abandoned.  Hell they don't even have the janitor work on it anymore in his spare time.  I actually left the game for a while and came back to what only a few new heroes had been released in years?  Once they put out ventures they basically turned the lights out except one nightlight.  If the core of the game wasn't so tied into br it would have totally been gone.
What is your epic?
i forgot.... raise power maybe?
I think you're right, but I also don't remember why I think he's Jack 🤔
https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Dreadmoc%230420/overview

You've literally cherry-picked the one and only good game you had today.
I don’t know what people you hang around but I’ve yet to meet someone that looks down on Valorant like you’ve described.

Maybe you’re mistaking it for League?
I would've died to the phoenix lmao. Well played though.
Let me ask related question what happens to this formula when u get tagged. Bcz u get slowed down so much that u can't use A or D to aim anymore. (Idk if ur mouse movement is also slowed when tagged)
Was it 28? My bad, if it was. I had a crazy few weeks and didn't get much time on, so I might be remembering wrong.
I never even tried it. I played with backbuttons since they came out on ps4
yea exactly. im sure theres the occasional asc2 that sneaks into immo1 with a big winstreak or into dia3 with a loss streak but this isnt talked about as much bc generally theres less people and even less of them care enough to whine in reddit
Saw this in 124 ventures somehow
Rat corners will always make the stinger viable. Holding close backsite on Breeze B site or default pyramid on A site for example.
i think you’re onto something
I mean it’s gotta be omen, man can just teleports out of prison
Exactly like yeah his positioning wasn’t the best but the whole point was the ridiculous amount of util being used to hunt him down lmao
Imagine bearing them with a disproportionate sick
I've seen people do this a lot in Warframe, thought that people were used to it in other games but i guess not lol
I like how the gekko sounds so terrified
i started faking drops after watching pros do it, can confirm it doesn't make a change because bronze doesn't wear headphones

Oh ok thanks
Bro that would have been a sick ace
Did it in the last month or two. How recent do you need?
"to know there is a limit to toxicity" it would seem like you don't know there is a limit. The only limit is when someone gets a chat ban, till that point it is all acceptable by rito standards
It’s a game, games are for fun. Play whatever’s fun for you
Aim. Click. Win.
The comment is definitely more about situational discipline (getting the jump on multiple enemies instead of just one) and crosshair discipline, meaning not shooting until your crosshair is in the right place. The number one problem with low elo gunfights is people shooting before their shot is lined up
the most toxic trolls in this game are not children they are in their early to mid 20s lol
Saying I’m coping is hilarious as no one in this sub is relevant , some dork saying there’s no smurfs isn’t important redditors are delusional so ya

Then the difference is probably in the decimals as others have said
They can't even get StW on switch.
i miss him :<
it says its non refundable so u cant
Muting is very different from lashing out, if somebody is annoying you ignore them, lashing out is the equivalent of screaming at them and flaming, you're not mentally stable enough to be on the internet if you start screaming at somebody cuz they were annoying, muting them just means ingoring them, usually I keep them muted for 2/3 rounds and then unmute them so i can still hear their comms while they won't bother me again cuz they think I muted them
I know how this feels. In 4 out of 4 games i played there was at least 1 troll on my team.. I just dont understans why people play if they're just gonna leave mid game or run with knife out and die bruh like what's the fun in that
these comments are funny asf , might as well add into it you saw fade dog bite and a whole trail plz stop instalocking reyna thank you.
Viper is not good as a solo controller on everymap really. Obviously in ranked you can make everything works so who cares, but still, maybe apart from breeze, you can't expect a viper to do the same job as another controller on any map.
Ye, I stick to 1skin per gun (crying because I bought chrono Sherrif a day b4 neo came out)
Thanks for the detailed reply!

OH NO HE POSTED IN THE WRONG SUBREDDIT LIKE AS IF THEYRE BOTH NOT FORTNITE OH GOD ITS THE END OF THE WORLD
It does look cool, not-so good when you've posted this to a subreddit that's only collabed with two other Epic Games games (that are currently in the afterlife for games)

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

* Casual Battle Royale - r/FortNiteBR
* Competitive Battle Royale - r/FortniteCompetitive
* Creative - r/FortniteCreative
* Lego - r/LEGOfortnite
* Rocket Racing - r/RocketRacing
* Festival - r/FortniteFestival
anything is not possible. i for one, do not have the ability to cast fireballs at will. i cannot train myself to do so. reaction speed can be improved yes, but only a tiny amount, and i mean, it honestly isnt gonna change jack for valorant players unless they are pros. 

anticipation is what u need to practice. know what to expect. that will better ur overall reaction speed. trying to get to the best raw reaction speed / reflexes doesnt do anything. never heard, never seen, never known anyone who does reaction speed training for games, or for literally anything.
maybe you and your friends has better comms because for me when playing with friends compared to solo is that good comms is a very huge deal like for example just having info of where they last seen the enemy going before they got killed makes it easier for me to kill the enemy from my experience. sorry for bad english.
Yeah I came looking for how to move the orange circle. Cause I accidentally built outside of it and it isn't counting for leveling it up. Which is making me so upset because I finally got it all even and smoothed out 😆
I did follow the old one, but if he has an updated version, go for the new one. I freely use abilities in comp matches. Ppl think no one uses utilities in low elo, but that's not true. With good guides, everyone knows somewhat basic utility. 

I have seen lineups, one-way smokes, grim walls, everything. Idk why ppl think there is no util usage in low elo. It might not be efficient as higher ranks, but their is util usage
He boosted is gf the other day on is smurf account. He said it was ok because he was playing badly that game and he was bottom fragging.
Yeah, Twine has no story and just a bunch of generic filler tasks that will never be replaced.  It’s technically easier to progress but also really dull when it’s just like “okay play 3 of this or that I guess” with no context or real objective.
Im hypersensitive to caffiene.

I play terrible on caffiene bc of it. I cant focus at all and im doing everything too fast so i whiff etc.

I end up with a headache and dizzy feeling too. (and it fucks my sleep) 

Cutting caffiene mostly out of my life was a great decision for me. I drink it occasionally now but usually when i intentionally want to be hyper (eg a party or smth)

Even the day after ill play trash bc of not sleeping properly. 

However im definitely a rare case. But in general idk if caffiene really benefits gaming. I think a good sleep is better than a coffee in the morning for gaming


Out of interest do u have ADHD? Ive heard ppl with adhd have the opposite reaction to caffiene than expected
How do people find these lineups bro
This is a team game not a solo game so idgaf about ace.      Earn ur ace and stop complaining. I had a lot of 4k in rounds but never complained about ace. Just win the round and thats it.
Thank You.
yeah duo with someone around ur skill level or a bit higher (too low and u ll just be held back and too high and u ll just get carried) u will get a reliable teammate, u can set up coordinated plays and climb together 
possibly because winning in overtime, possibly because the top 4 of second game were super close in kills, game may have also wanted to make sure you deserve to stay in the rank you ranked up to, who knows
Good point that's why the option would be in or off in settings.

However people alive need to hear one door step to win a round sometimes
I feel like crouch spraying is a very useful mechanic because it thins out the spray pattern. Although when people in lower ranks hear that its useful they overuse it and do it in every fight or skirmish. The fact is that while its useful you have to learn when its useful. So whenever people say stop crouch spraying they mean stop doing it every time and learn when to use it rather than have the reflex to do it everytime there is an exchange of bullets.
This is simply untrue. Of course headshots are not everything for winning. But the higher you get the more important it gets. At the end of the day you have to kill your enemies faster than they kill you. And landing headshots is simply the best way to do it.
Yea....I am actually trying to get this out as much as I can. Because it would make sense if it was only me getting it, but if the whole tram is also report but we still get the warnings and ban...something is not right. I might push it on tiktok too don't know yet. Still trying to figure out the best way to handle it and also wanting to find out if it happened to other players as well.
It's not dying. This game has solidified themselves to the core hyper competitive games like cs, dota and league now. It will take a long time for this game to "die" now. I think they are just getting started. As soon as replay system is added the game will have another hype phase on top of that console official release and mobile release will even make this game popular. I think in theory we don't know the exact numbers but in terms of popularity of this game it had exceeded cs, especially because cs2 is just in a terrible state with cheaters and game being problematic than csgo. 

Also the meta has drastically changed finally with recent iso neon patch now. It's fresh right now and a lot of people are having resurgence of fun again.
oh yeah my bad haha. I didn't know they were different things. so now that u know, why doesn't remake work for me even when I use it in round 2 (with members afk since round 1)?
They get a level for every shot they make
[removed]
Anyone who complains about dying to a crouched player is bad because you’d know crouching is a legit strat to throw off people’s aim, but there are times when someone crouch’s and you just know it was done out of habit and was not a voluntary decision, then those times it feels a bit annoying aha
I need to learn phantom. I feel like it would help me immensely on bind, as I find myself uncomfortable defending with vandal. I usually end up playing heaven and B-site CT for defense
idk why but this is funny as shit
Am I not crouch spraying?

Nice shot but I felt like the ryan gosling in the meme while I waited
I watch a lot of valorant videos of guides, lineups etc. I just don't play much and I'm still a beginner so it's hard to think what I usually would when I'm stressed about clutching.
It's different because you can choose not to surrender to stats. Most of the people that DC at the beginning is for dodging.

 I am not surrendering to stats, I am sorry, it's ridiculous.
Your post has given me strength brother. Just the day before yesterday, for the first time ever, I climbed to gold 2 from silver 3 (been a year since I started playing)

I was so frustrated yesterday after getting stomped by plat and diamond players in my gold lobby. I dunno why even ascendant previous acts are playing against me, a poor silver player.

The problem is, I've never seen util usages to such an extent and all players were super cunning in gun fights. There wasn't a single fair duel. My brain couldn't keep up with that. I closed the game after 4 losses. 

Now I'm in gold 2. I understand the difference between them and me is like night and day. I hope I'll learn from the game and reach at least plat 1 before the end of this act

Greek and Turkish people dont get along really well so I can guess thats a reason for greeks to stay away from Istanbul.
Dude I know they fixed split with the changes in the past but there is NO fixing breeze. Just call it DOA and move on man. Rigor mortise has set in and there is no pulse. 

Thing is, they've hit on so many maps, that there is no shame in just leaving some behind. Icebox and Breeze can and should stay out.
So you’re saying iso is better than a dude that can teleport across the map, has trip that stays active from anywhere, has a deagle built into the character, and has a free op with super fast fire rate that leaves a sage slow orb on the ground after a kill?
Like others said. Just play and have fun, if you're losing fights and rounds think about why and when you play someone better than you try to notice the things they do and implement them yourself
Well hopefully I'm one of the lucky few! (likely no because I'm level 400)
Valorant abilities make the game more strategic, but there's an intentional choice by riot to make it less mechanically challenging. 

E.g. map designed with head height markers, smokes being easily placed, no counter-strafing and no set recoil patterns. 

Which is honestly a nice choice, means more players can interact with the game at a macro level at casual/low ranks.
Becouse people hate using their ults for some reason. They think it’s a rarity and should be saved and used only in the best case scenario.
Why is it hard to believe he hit radiant on controller? It’s a role you can thrive in with good game knowledge.
sometimes? for example if you're lower than the enemy. e.g. you are peeking Haven A short as CT and there's a corpse on the A short entrance, you might not see someone peeking from outside A lobby
1. Take a break. 
2. Watch Valorant tutorials (trust me it really helps)

IDK my Elo I don't play Ranked but it usually works.

Her Value on Attack is the same as Cypher's I guess. Sensors are a big Counter to Neon for Example because she just runs. She also has the Wall to prevent Retakes, placing it deep stops the Enemies from getting anywhere close to Site or wastes their Ammo.
Nothing that can help, other than to say I've had the same issue on multiple accounts on multiple devices
Already at my peak rank after reset, but getting a little bit more people who start throwing after a hand few rounds. But still no problem playing ranked
Ego is king
I'm sure you can afford at least one of them, you just know better to not spend money on a game like Valorant.
i feel there are some sparks between cypher and fade
They helped me a ton. I can really see the difference between myself and my friends who only play casually without training or studying, even though they play more than I do. I've steadily improved while they are very much stuck in their ways and don't really understand what they are doing wrong, what is holding them back, or how to fix it. There is only so much insight you can gain on your own, in a vacuum.
I mean I agree with your main point that unrated is unplayable. I'm not good (bronze) and half the time I play unrated there are 8 players around my level and like one good player on each time (usually dia or better), and it's just whoevers "good player" can carry harder wins lol.
No knife is rarer than another, unless they are limited skins. It's just a cool knife skin and quite popular, so people want it in their shop but don't get it, so I guess it can be considered rare or at least "desired".
I feel like its such a unavoidable thing but ig
What most people are saying is true, you only need to log all inputs to a file and have it be downloaded to the player's machine at the end. They already have Chronobreak, the framework they use to rewind tournament matches, it essentially is a replay system that records all inputs and permutations.

BUT... It works in tournaments where they have special servers and a different game client. Incorporating it into the public client would demand a complete overhaul of the server infrastructure, so you really need to take one step at a time, and at the end you're still gonna have to deal with making it feasible to log and store every single match for extended periods of time. A single match could go from 100 to 300 Megabytes on average, and the sole task of recording all matches would impact on the client-server communication and responsiveness, which can cause game-breaking glitches
Friends are more important than ur rank.
I think I actually know what you mean, but that wasn't me, I haven't even run Lynx in command in the MSK for months - but your idea sounds like great content, please tag me in when you write them!
Maybe the real nerf to Jett was the people that stopped playing them 😂

She is my least picked agent but I agree that the Jetts I’ve been encountering in ranked are demons.
I got one appreciate the offer!
Its either $50 skins or Nicki Minaj, no in-between
It's mostly 2 skins slapped on different guns, I'm not against it, just not for it.
I'll keep my money mostly bc I don't agree with their weird pricing, but most games do that now so.
Public 160s:
As they should to be honest. Same deal with their partnership to make Arcane, which was a huge hit.
> Thats why she needs a rework, pub stomper and rank demon, never see her in pro play.

Riot has no problem with this. There are champions in league that don't really see pro play. 

Assuming the balance philosophy is the same, Riot will balance with proplay in mind. (a champ like Azir, or Ryze for example is kept in a pretty crippled state for Solo Q)

Here is a pretty dated read, which is quite league-centric

The suggestion I thought of a while ago was make her dash more like Genji's dash/slice ability in OW where you have to be looking in the direction you want to dash to. It'd definitely make you have to flick more.
Thanks! I'm curious as well. But tbf I played a lot during these 2 months, I have 170h in comp only
The way Reyna said "nice try bro" makes it sadder
In order to see the cause of you losing games I would have to see the gameplay. Tracker alone doesn't say much maybe except that you don't play consistently. One match per day for a week is way more beneficial that spamming 8 games in one day and not playing for the next 6 days. Also don't expect to improve rapidly after a week or two, you need to give it time and with constant practice and thinking about what mistakes you make you will eventually achieve your goal. Peace
Yes, i wasnt even thinking of it, i had it equipped because i think its fun to spam it lmao
The Skye in my game just said “they won’t even get an inch”
I see, i understand what do you mean. I guess it really comes down to staying in the game mentally and understanding the enemies' playstyle. Thanks for the explanation!

it’s almost always true, if i see the ping not moving (after they say AFK) i just start making my way to spawn, ping fluctuations happen no matter what, just keep watching it and have your gun up
Even flingers have secret elements! I played a dungeons game a long time ago and for some reason a nature element flinger had spawned. Kinda lame how they are locked to dungeons. But then if they weren’t then that would sorta defeat the purpose of physical element weapons 🤷‍♂️
If you hit radiant you should be able to walk into immo2 on character with no abilities.
What's different about it other than it returning a week later?
Meh its more of a decision, like you wouldnt kj ult as an attacker when theres less than 15 sec left and you can’t get spike down, thats like the same situation here don’t deadlock ult the last person if you can’t get spike down and not enough time
\`\`This is the dumbest comment I’ve seen.\`\`

You typed your original comment your eyes closed?
Eh harbor can throw his Cove for whoever is planting. He doesn't necessarily have to have the bomb himself
Yeah I had a game where I went 13/11/17 in 20 rounds and had a lower ACS than a person who had less ADR, less DD, worse KAST, but had 4 more kills (and 11 less assists). Overall I was 5th for ACS when I think at worst I should've been 3rd.

https://tracker.gg/valorant/match/a6fc6a95-858e-4f1e-aaa6-909234631af1

I get not all assists are damage related, but how can they not attribute to ACS if it's helping your team (in the system's eyes) get a kill? Why even give me an assist if it's not actually doing anything to help me get more RR for that particular win. It's literally just there to make you feel better lol.

that being said I do think for your scenario of getting late round kills where they mean less since your team is all dead and they're considered low impact (unless you do clutch a 1v3 or whatever), ACS does account for that pretty sure. I could be wrong though.

In general ACS is a really terrible metric. I would only pay attention to it if it's below 100 (maybe even a bit lower) or like above 350. That's a decent line for knowing who is severely struggling or really dominating. The shitty thing is that you get massively different RR gains based on it.
Could've gone pro if it weren't for the husks
Coool downs are perfect for keeping tdm fun and balanced. They could 100% shorten them a teeny bit. But right now, I don't feel anything sacrificed. I thought tdm would be awful ability spam garbage, and it's now my pre comp warmup over DM. If they change ability cooldowns, cringe metas will spawn more.
Well, you already know what you're supposed to do so why even make the post?

&#x200B;

It also depends on the severity of the toxicity. There are toxic people who screech and try to act smug and personally? Never pressed mute faster than when I meet them. There are the people who get tilted and I try to empathize with them even when they say something toxic towards us so they feel relief. In case that doesn't work, I just move on or mute and move on.
I'm not going to lie ... even without the glitch, I sometimes build like this (except i use t1 wood) ... with Ice King in my commander slot, this configuration goes from total trash to a functional meme strategy.
Most smurfs are in duos or trios too. I agree.
Play the controller you’re comfortable with. Why be okay at all of them when you can be amazing at one? 

There are maps that other controllers are stronger at… but you’re new. Obviously cause you’re just now unlocking him.

Omens major flaw is that he only has 2 smokes that are fairly short though they recharge. Large maps or maps with large sightlines need different agents. 

This isn’t an answer to what you asked, but is the answer. I am an ascendant 1 players btw

Overwatch was easier. Valorant is not easy.

Yea, penalties reduce the more you play without offenses.
100%.. after rewatching your vods, i think you are too stationary. Great aim, bad movement (for valorant). See: strafe tapping
thats your opinion. i posted online, so you get to post your opinion of what i said. isnt the internet amazing!

Most noticeable trend is that you are getting cooked on sunset, ascent, split, and bind. Watch some vods for Cypher on those maps

You and your main duo king are at a 42% win rate at like 50 matches.
Does that show gameplay across all platforms or only the one you’re looking at it on? Cuz I played on Xbox when fn came out for like a year then os4 for a few years then ps5 for 2 years and now a pc… so is there somewhere I can look for the total of all of them together ?
Valorant should be on steam so that we can buy from steam market and sell whenever we want to have different skin.
Create a Support Ticket , got many people banned that way :) ( even Hwid Bann cause they admited they use Wallhack and Riot can't do anything about it) and i can confirm this because i added 3 really toxic idiots after the game and they wanted to talk in DC to trashtalk  some more , so i recorded them , send a Support Ticket to Riot , sended  them the Ingame names with the Ingame records and dc Talk and boom they are gone for ever :D 

But If you can't handle such ppl in an online game where nobody knows you , just don't play comp at all , so you can keep your mental up :) !
Good for what? I’m a plat2 peak with 14%hs.
reaver vandal then reaver sherrif then oni phantom then over 1.5k in skins lol
Yup ain't much you can do about it. In theory you'll also get games where your team mates carry you so it should even out. Riots fear of smurfs makes the game focused more on hidden mmr than actual rank so ranks don't mean too much
Istg the worst player that I have ever seen and it make me question my existence was bronze and not iron. I can’t imagine someone being a hardstuck iron.
For stuff like this, discord is really worth it.
I played MSK on fill and wasn’t able to do it with random teammates for 2 hours straight. Asked in the Beast Discord and instantly finished it.

Still say it should be uncapped for at least founders who paid a pretty penny  only to get ripped. But that's just my bitterness and heart break talking 🙃
The scoring isn't based on how easy or difficult it is to get a kill but on how much that kill helps your team.

If you "lurk" every round (not actually creating pressure, just sitting opposite side of the map while your whole team dies in the execute) and then kill 3 in the 1v5...those were very difficult kills to get, but utterly useless because your team still lost the round.

Getting the first blood immediately directly increases the chance your team will win the round from 50% to more like 60%, or even higher if your team is coordinated and communicating well.
U said ur pl 93 and doing twine assuming so it depends on how stats are distributed is ur health ur lowest stat two is all it loadout heros as high as they can be and none that aren't level up decently well aka at least around 106 level
dufaq language is this?

Let me get this straight, you basically want to afk for xp.... then build a proper endurance and do it yourself.
There is a feature right now where husks can't walk over mats on the ground. In many cases they just despawn.
Cypher is completely overtuned rn the fact that you need sova or raze to break his trips often enough makes him a pain in the ass to play against to the point where with most comps you just have to avoid him. He was the better option even before they nerfed killjoy last patch because he has unlimited range with 2 trips that are basically unbreakable sometimes. So for me he is too strong right now especially in comparison to the rest, they literally buffed 2-3 things at once with the buff which is crazy.
Ur a freak lmao
Yes, but it's similar (the same?) to Brim smoke radius. If you die attacking site, you will be able to smoke CT for your team the rest of the round. If you die defending site you will be able to smoke for retake. If you die mid on Lotus you can smoke the entrance to both other sites. It's only really bad on larger maps like Breeze, or if you die on the site where the spike does not end up. But even then, twice in a half you should be able to self res in that scenario.
Comms and leadership

I blame this sub for every omen player I get on my team who only uses smokes and blind selfishly and offers so little to the team.
no riot put a line of code in the game that caps you at Asc3 if you are under 144 hz.

Seriously, of course it's possible. why it wouldn't it be? At that level though investing in a higher refresh rate monitor will be worth it.
You watched too many pro games? Do we play the same game where 8/10 people dont even have a mic on? Do you genially expect a 5 random dudes that arent even guaranteed to speak english somehow strategically planning a "teamwork based" site attack? Are you fucking sincerely blind or are you just this annoying redditor trying to argue anything cause you have nothing else to spend your time on? Well, I dont want to spend aby more time explaining something obvious to a 5yo monkey so dont bother me please.
Let him get comfortable with the game. Worst thing you can do is make it hard for him, leading to him possibly not enjoying the game. Everyone starts somewhere.
Why do you hate me so much lol? 

I even linked my channel which I posted tonight of vods, which if you actually take some time of your day to watch will prove that I don’t really ever pick fights with my teammates and even helping them with callouts and stuff.

What’s more is that you’re probably in your 30’s hating in a random 18yo kid that you don’t even know on reddit lmao
If you think I'm just going to be sitting there waiting to get headshot then I'm certain I'm higher than you.

With how the proplay meta is going, if it was implemented in an effective way and the agent had even decent utility in terms of non-ults, it'd have the highest pickrate of any agent in proplay.

That's insane, it's definitely rare but I've had few people pick neon and top frag in my games. I've also top fragged a few times with her. Whether it's just me not being consistent or the agent. I seem to either go double positive on neon or double negative, very rarely have I been in the middle with neon

I never got it even tho I played in many games with cheaters. One we won 13-0 the dude would just run and one tap everyone…

The red screen is yet to be seen for me but omg I sometimes wished for it. Also had a 3 stack try to play legit but it was still possible to see it. Knowing where KJ util was and one tapping it before seeing it. Or using drones “perfectly” all the time. 10ms between line of sight and death with them even tho they had 140ping
She shouldn’t be.
You’re welcome
atleast valorant acts as an asylum to these people so we see them less in other games
switch to directx 11 from performance.
Same, i can have terrible game from time to time ofr no reason, it's important to know when to stop for the day or take a break of comp and you can always switch to swiftplay to just relax and have fun
i do not mean that he walls or anything, i more meant like the crosshair kinda snaps onto Skye and even more on Cypher for example. But like i said in my first comment i might be mistaken with my limited knowledge on cheater in valorant but it looked phishy enought to comment in my opinion and see what other users think about it.
why?
Fuck learning agents and grinding. People who only wanna play casual modes exist too.
If anyone has a code left I would really appreciate it if I could get one
I don't know much about Reyna, never played her before. But you have to buy the "heal skill" no? Is it common to buy it (twice) in the Pistol Round?
Don’t worry you’ll only be spending a 1000$ 🤡

Phantom performs better, Vandal feels better

(Arguably, Vandal exceptionally performs better on breeze, where long-range fights are more prevalent)
Hey so in case you didn't know this, most people aren't deaf in one ear, let alone two. Stop making excuses for a lack of headphones, because there is obviously exceptions.
buying a gun skin goes towards the price of the bundle so its weird that the knife price doesnt go towards it too (ik its because the knife is technically free but its still dumb).
In my opinion its pearl
It wasn’t a crosshair, it was an actual scope on the weapon
anyone has a invite left pls?
Unrated doesnt even work cause thats where all the smurfs are to levelup so you get stomped anway
bronze 2 after four days ! :D

then two months to reach silver 2..
people that hear a girl's voice and immediately start asking for onlyfans, edating etc. this is too annoying. if i queue and talk (which i try to do as im playing in asc/immo), i receive either an inappropriate or sexist reactions, which makes it even more frustrating bcs i am not into men at all

not any of the weapons you mentioned but there is dasnerth. he used to be judge only(recently started stopped judge only around a year ago)but when he was judge only he got to #1 NA before, and was radiant using judge cypher only. He still uses the judge/shorty a lot but not nearly as much as he used to
they should probably explain what the fuck a remake is when you first load up into ranked
Yeah true tho
i say it how i see it.
You’re not baiting me
17h isn’t bit early to make a list?
P3 to p1 then to d2 now I'm stuck
It’s not even rumours. They confirmed it and it also to phone
Okay I get what u mean and I presume since u have been to gold ur aim is pretty good so just play Reyna till u can get to atleast silver 3. I know I sound weird with my advice but Reyna in lower ranks Dosent care about any team she can just carry and that's exactly what you should do to save urself the trouble of dealing with bad teammates
Same reason spike is still in spawn buddy
console valorant has aim assist..?
Found the jett main here
You actually still get the STW Access because it's an actual reward item that shows up on screen with the other stuff. It just doesn't do anything because you already have it.
I don't know if it was him exactly, but I played with someone when I was climbing out of iron who was doing knife only with a friend. It was effectively a 3v5 the whole game which was so frustrating because we had a Cypher and Reyna that got 30 something kills apiece. It was one of the worst experiences I ever had playing this game and it makes me a bit upset to see content creators doing this.
In west Canada (low elo) even though people are supposed to be nice if you lose a 5v1 on a save you get so much diss 🙄

When the acts reset I’m pretty sure your mmr does too. I’ve seen a lot of posts like this since the new act and it happened to me too. I think especially with times like these you almost just have to accept that your personal mmr is getting back to where it should be. Let it sort itself out. And then just work from there.
What???? 600h in and i just hit Diamond
Cypher is still pretty hung up on the whole dead wife thing

Lmao. How do you know when you've encountered a cheater?
I miss mini boss season
#1 watch some eggster vods. He’s consistently high radiant and even hit rank 1 a couple times so he’s a really good one to watch

#2 don’t be afraid to dump all your utility into a site take. It can be very oppressive if your flash tp’ing in while your clone comes out of the choke breaking all the sentinel until and your team is following you out

#3 if you have ult, by a shorty. On ECO you can buy a Bucky and steal a gun which is lit

#4 don’t fall into a pattern. Mic up your playstyle. Maybe one round you’ll lurk and tp back to the team, another you’ll fast entry, and maybe another you’ll go on an aggressive flank. Keep em guessing
In case you're not trolling. Throwing rounds intentionally and against your teammates' wishes is mean and does no good. Your teammates not doing what you want doesn't mean they aren't trying to win the game, even if their actions would seem dumb to you.
Kd and placement on leader board don't super matter. In another post, someone dropped riots statements on how ranking works. To summarize what it said is in lowranks (ascendant 3 and lower) hidden mmr and rr are determined more by individual performance, which riot determines as value. So if your friend runs in kills 2 and dies in a 5v5, he will get less mmr/rr than if he was in a 1v1 and clutches even though it's only 1 kill, not 2. Basically some kills have more value then others and assists/site executes/utility usage all have effects as well he can have a higher kd but if your kills are more valuable or you execute site with your team or you use utility more and better then him you can still be considered "better" with a lower kd.

All good. If you main any agent, I recommend watching some one tricks for their gimmicks and then move onto any pros/high elo streamers who play the agent a lot.
Speaking of the power a controller, anyone know how to remap the back paddles? When I got my controller, I followed the steps to remap the one back paddle to jump and it was already mapped to shoot, and now when I hit it, it jumps and shoots lol and I threw the instructions out, but obviously even with the instructions I did some shit wrong lolol
Thanks! Crosshair placement really is such a simple concept but hard for many players to implement.
Someone will likely post it byt just make sure to get the plasmatic launcher from the event shop. Very very very powerful weapon. Almost broken powerful but its better to not say that
oh i misread the post. my fault.

vs a neon that does the whole run around thing, you should not buy any semi auto wep at any point during the game.

always spectre or phantom. that way u never have to land hard shot
My statement is 100% correct and is the consensus among high mmr league players. There’s literally no debate about this at all.
Play around them. Instead of bending the little brain all aimlets to your will, just roll with whatever dumb shit their pea brain thinks of. 90% of the time, you can set them up and then  they can outaim the site anchor for a free round. 

the game is baby sitting and getting a better performance out of your team. Also, quite a few duelists/senti/controllers have the ability to impact an angle and make it not a dry 50/50. ISO can deadass just tank the first bullet for free…

You have to talk, otherwise you’re going to be frustrated and continually getting rounds where you’re in the middle of nowhere.
I mostly play kj and sage, so using my ult is not always available/convenient, also sometimes I die before I get to use it.
Split. Its not fun at all unless both your teammates and opponents are good enough to utilize the map's dynamics.

Other than that, every game plays the same and its boring af.
Why go for the headshot when the body shot was right there? Larger area to hit, and it’s a one hit kill regardless
This is interesting lore that I wish Riot took more advantage of instead of creating a couple of banners and calling it a day.
whats special about it?
Need one for EU 🙏🏻

i mean so am i, but i still hate them. my haven winrate is probably half of my breeze winrate, but it's still more fun to me.
Makes sense, you’ll use them often regardless. In Apex it’s more important to keep as many movement options on the mouse, so you’d probably fit right in.
i know i think this sample size of 2 just looks funny
SOLO UNRATED = 3

UNRATED WITH FRIENDS = 10

SOLO RANKED = 2 Sometimes is very frustrating.  
RANKED WITH FRIENDS = 7.

Ah damn so step 1 is to make too much money and THEN enter the dome of trolls
Play tons of death matches
Basically every single shot here was inaccurate so this is not a good case for the keyboard mattering.
Using Sennheiser hd560s and all i can say that no gaming headset can match it. Still have my Krakens and even the Razer Blackshark v2 pro sound like shit when compared. Playing mainly Valorant if it matters.
I only play neon because I have severe adhd
The counter to his trips is to attack different angles. Many Cyphers will have a trip at waist level so you can't jump it. A Jett can easily updraft and dash over it. Same for raze satchel. Iso can take him in ult or wall while trip is broken.

Cypher's trips have been garbage for so long that people aren't used to getting hit by them. It used to be, you get hit and just keep going because fuck Cypher. Now you actually have to respect the trips, the same way you respect KJ mollies.
He's had the sub only chat since forever, ever since I found out about him a year or 2 ago, I wanted to watch him vod reviewing popular radiant streamers, everytime he would make a point that I don't fully agree with, I'd try to point it out but would never be able to do so since his chat is restricted, he tends to over analyse every micro movement in the vod reviews to a ridiculous extent, i remember one time fakeananas was being vod reviewed and he hopped on stream, everytime wohoojin would predict that he did this specific play for this one reason, ananas would respond with something along the lines of "didnt really think about it at the time, was just out of instict or common sense".


Even from personal experience as someone who has been in low immo 3 since ep 5 act 3, over analysing every micro decision and movement is something you do NOT wanna do in a ranked game, it messes up with your reaction time, confidence and decision making, it is exactly what you do not wanna do if you want to make It to higher ranks. I'm not saying this out of cockiness, but if I really cared enough I'd be able to make it to  radiant by finding a solid duo and playing 10-15 games a day, that really is all it takes, I only have an average of 40 total wins per act since ive hit immo 3 for the first time, that was my only goal and now I just play the game casually to maintain it.

I'm not trying to say wohoojin gives bad advice, to be quite honest I barely watched a stream or 2 and some of his videos back in the day, he might very well give out solid advice nowadays since everyone in the low ranks praises him (haven't really seen any good immo/radiant players praising him but that's besides the point). I'm not really surprised about his account being bought either, I've never seen him play himself besides in custom games, even then his performance is barely worth any praises.

 All I'll say is, if you really want to get better at the game, play more, warm ups are fine but shouldn't take more than 5 mins of your total play time, watch good players such as nats, curry, s0m etc... obviously don't try to mimic them since they have good teammates for the most part, but try to educate yourself more by watching them, and the most important one of all, get yourself a duo that also wants to improve and rank up, it makes the journey a lot more easier and fun.
There can’t be THAT many smurfs
I want to main reyna but its hard to entry with no smokes no initiator. So now i main neon.
Sounds like he was just a toxic asshole and you should've just mutted him at some point.

He probably opens a lot of event llamas or something
Ah yeah, maybe you're right! Skye also has a line about an enemy Sage, something about an "imbalance."

Also, probably unrelated but there's a voice message from Sage about her questioning her healing abilities because Deadlock likes her funny robotic arm. Maybe this will cause her to find out where her healing comes from?
Well, it could also mean 1 more kill. That's why you gotta use it at the right time. Sure if you never use it correctly and always just die it's probably bad for your rr gains lol. But that's why you gotta use it to learn when to use it so it gains you rr instead
Never. Even Radiants have their moments. 🤷🏽‍♂️

Yes if your aim is good but "good" is relative. If you grinded before and gold 1 was your peak, aimless won't change much tbh lol. It will just take hours of game time to get better in your case. If you were high tier at aiming in other fps games and such then yes you'd rank up quick over time.
Turn on movement error graph, go into a game and shoot your gun while sliding. If it's blue it means your bullets are nowhere near your crosshair. You know what I meant.
It's interesting because I play NA and have the opposite experience. My plat account gets thrashed every time I make a miniscule mistake whereas the silver lobbies say it's okay/get em next time etc.

yes corners make a difference, you can shoot though most of them but it also depends on weapons, stronger weapons can shoot through more walls.

Everyday I pray that they allow the same Ventures PL to join in on existing missions or allow Access of Lower Ventures PL zones.
What i do is laugh at them to myself (or friends if playing with friends) but then play dumb and egg them on in game

Its called we do a little trolling
went from silver to radiant the second i bought it
aim will carry you to the top 10% easily. Its a shooter game, if you can out aim your enemy you will almost certainly win more.

You are not playing diamonds as a bronze be for real...
I'm a founder
You’re level 26. I hope you know that most people
Place iron and bronze and it takes a while to get. You have to understand the flow of the game more you may have watched a tutorial or two that said to do something learned a lineup or two but until you can start doing that thing on game and actually know when and what that lineup does instead of throwing it absent mindedly every round you aren’t going to rank up. It’s about practice not just watching a video
Could just get viewer clips or lower tier online tournaments

>I'm just more optimistic about the process

What process? We haven't heard anything about the process. Literally everytime someone from Riot comments on the replay system they say "Haha, we're working on it..." and nothing else.
y hahh
It’s just the fact that you can’t actually guarantee the site anchor dies. 

Yes, a 4v4 on attack is slightly advantageous. But a 5v4 is a massive disadvantage. 

If the odds on getting the former are 100%, it’s a no brainer correct choice. But if those odds are 80%, then the overall odds of the game go down. That 20% rate of being 4v5 is a bigger negative than 80% rate on being 4v4 attack.
I aint begging for nothing im only trying to promote have to do it somehow
Omen saying “that was fun”
That is an amazing pit, they're just coping
I show a lot of emotion when I play. I have a lot of fun.

As you can imagine, I have thousands of hours in valorant and I experience toxic players like everyone else.

For example, I tried to pick up the bomb while on defense.

I got absolutely harassed because of this by my entire team the rest of the game.

Instead of being upset, I made a joke out of it and they ended up liking me at the end.

Stop being a victim.

>higher impact does more structural damage

after testing this isn't true! was it change in an update?
I think you should give people a chance

second if you find complaining or whining to be so bad you probably need to work on that as a skill, the skill of resiliance. 

Think about what people are saying, a lot of whining and complaining is rooted in actual meaningful issues, but people just have this natural reaction to dismiss it. Then people never learn or never try to fix their mistakes.
Not really adding anything to the topic at hand, but I just want to say, people who smurf have tiny penises.

That's all.
i had someone log into my account and basically play like shit to derank for about a month until i noticed and changed my passwords...sooo anything is possible. they also straight up changed my skin loadout.
Same, i dont talk unless im with a friend or something. Too scared to try it even if there is another woman. 

I have heard a lot of fucked up shit already.
If you have enough PL, there are 5x missions on PL160 maps
bro it's like 7 minutes
their night market is a joke. They dont care about the players, they care about money.

Why would they when no popular streamer (as far as i know) has ever complained about how greedy riot has been with valorant

People keep paying and they dont care about the minority of fully f2p players.
She could self heal 100 hp
I also have PTT bound to my mouse 4 button and I get this and exact problem. It's infuriating because my PTT button works during agent select but then I HAVE to use 'v' once the game loads. I don't even have 'V' specified as a button to use for PTT too. It just defaults.
You need to get a clue. Each and every Valorant player worldwide is NOT supposed to have the exact same gaming experience as everyone else worldwide. OP’s complaints are valid.
I don't understand what u said. So I should walk horizontally from peak point? Is there a video on this?
I thought it was hilarious being called a troll, literally didn’t even know how to plant spike after a good round and everyone was mad at me. I just knew how to get kills at that point haha.
Agents, once you have all of them or think you have enough you can start buying other stuff like player cards, gun buddy’s etc
For a overall role I would say controller, easiest ones probably being brimstone, omen etc. You just need to know smokes placements. Duelist aswell because most duelists just rely on kills for utility. Duelists like reyna, phoenix, and iso are pretty easy to play. I wouldn’t suggest any characters in the initiator/sentinel roles because those are very util heavy and generally require more game sense.
Just mute, the game is so much better when you just silence toxic people. I also only turn all chat on when im doing well. 9/10 times the enemy never has anything positive to say.
Obviously Woohoohjin is the same person as JayG. Case closed, call me if you need anything.
Why are you getting down voted?  Filling is a fing terrible idea in low elo.
I imagine it tastes like this foam footballs from gym class
You re playing only for a few weeks, maybe everyone is new, nobody really cares in low elo. But soon you will meet the sweaty hardstuck guys who are frustrated they re stuck at a certain elo and will blame you for it
best of luck on your future endeavours
I’m having the same issue
Truly, you're better off just going solo, friends, or just posting in this subreddit for help requests. Those leeches are pretty much just br players and/or little kids that don't know anything outside of just holding a trigger on their guns.  If you come across a legitimate rando, talk with them and see if they'd like to join ye. But again, you're better off just going solo/friends because even on them games with randos that you pretty much do everything, you'll get them toxic mfs that can easily sabotage the game. That's also why I'd just go as ninja with the soaring mantis unless you actually need to play as a specific class because with the ninja I can easily get around my setups quickly, as well as acquire any quest items quickly.

Okay fat anime fan
Show me one series where Demon1 has 90% HS, I'll wait.

yeah winning team round 3 now have outlaw against the loosing team round 3 having light shield and vandals. making the winning team one shoting everyone for their bonus round
Quick question bc I genuinely don't know, Clove is confirmed non binary but does clove have confirmed pro-nouns? All my non binary acquaintances are fine with he/she/they but everyone's freaking out if clove is called she? again, a question with no malice, please try to actually educate me so I can be correct.
I still need 800+ survis to platinum this game after that who knows
Yeah I can relate on the stress part😅

It gets easier, don't worry🙏🏼
OP, there is also more armory slots available for purchase in the store every season. You can buy up to 100 so you can store more things.
Tbh I think they should just make it that if you buy stw, you do get vbucks, but just half of what founders would get
Rodger that my bad
That’s probably it then, a slow response time isn’t just blurry or ghosting pixels, my previous monitor was also va and its delay as I have now realised was potentially slow enough that some enemies could potentially have killed me before my display even showed me the enemy. If I were to guess that’s what’s probably happening to you, I almost never experience instant 1 taps anymore
smurf acc no way toxic players are only playng 1 acc
Nope, you’ll still want that as a Sunbeam weapon.

When I say “90%”, I mean 99%. The only reason for Obsidian weapons are to have as backups in the off-chance you run out of sunbeam materials.
I played Frostnite (level 100) for the first time this season last night.  I instantly got into a match with a another constructor and a couple of outlanders.  One of the outlanders dropped out halfway through, but we still managed to get through wave 16.  Not bad for a group of randoms.

Is it normally hard to find a group for Frostnite?  I don't remember having any issues in years past, but I didn't play last winter.  These days I mostly play solo to avoid bad teammates and drama, but I'm not good enough to solo Frostnite.
There's a reason people call anything below immo3 low elo xd
i have tried basically everything
This happened in a game with me. Showed my brother off in the distance as brimstone with a shorty. He was in the game with me and playing astra so basically it’s a ghost of ragers past
I literally only play comp. I’m diamond. Stop talking shit, this does not happen to you daily, let alone multiple times a day.

nah. gekkos i play with usually knife me or scream at me until i give it to them

then they decide to peek mid and get their head blown off. or they decide not to plant at all
I was trying to pick agents that help my team the most but your right. I should just play what looks cool and what I have fun with :)
Those lobbies still arent fun to play in though regardless of which team the duo is on. This also implies they only ever queue together on these accounts and they always try as hard on each time and he doesnt end up getting too far out of her rank tange.

Overpass fucking sucks dude. Ancient is like 100 times better (maybe because I cant hold connector
Every clutch round I can tell where each person is and how to act accordingly to get the victory. I also try bait them into using utility so I can get info on them.

StW is definitely fun and worth playing even with a flaw like this, but don't expect new features or fixes often, we got one new hero today and that's basically StW Christmas. A bug that someone told me was present since like chapter 2 season 5 of BR got just fixe like 2 or 3 months ago. Sometimes things(features, not items) break or disappear. But despite all this, StW still has an awesome main story and event side stories, missions, events and ventures. It's fun alone or with strangers, but best with friends who actually enjoy it.

Have fun playing.
Origin is the best vandal skin
Hardly especially for a free game.
I mean 4 bullet is enough for bodyshot kills too with Vandal.
I’m confused… if you match MVP 80% of the time, then when you win games wouldnt you gain significantly more ELO than you lose? I mean, as long as your win rate isn’t below like 40%, would you not still climb?

I’m gold 2, but still climb even though my win rate is below 50% from carrying the team more often than not. 

I was bronze 3 at the start of this act.
Used vpn when i created an Account. In europe its easy, create a Turkish Account and u spent less than half the Money it normally costs

You should also be getting significantly more RR for wins than him. His MMR thinks he belongs in bronze/silver so will try to push him there with worse gains and harsher RR losses. The opposite is true for you
I almost forgot to mention this, but because of how often it kept hitting that one particular spot— I forgot about Point A and by the time I did remember, I wasn't able to properly trap it since everything else I had was practically useless level wise. 😶
I actually agree that Bigger doesn't line up 1 for 1 with better.

However, what other metric is there? Your personal opinion? Is that the metric we should use?

Size gets used because it's a direct measurement of how many players care enough to watch the esport.
A little over $300, spread between two phantom skins, one vandal skin (but I might buy another), a ghost skin, a classic skin, Sherrif skin, spectre skin and OP skin, and the new ignite skin - plus a few battle passes and agents I paid to unlock when I first got the game bc I’m impatient
Alright thank you

Changelog:

C Radius set to 4 Meters.  
Q given a Location Ping of every second.  
E Given a Radius of 7 Meters.  
Ultimate cost increased by 1 point, to 7.  
Duration however, increased from 6, to 10 seconds. Should balance out that utility better.
I told him I’d be there in 5 so he got ready
Ok the Mystbloom is fucking beautiful at least so if you were going to overspend on skins you picked a good extra
they're right but u don't have to be first entry. u take first contact early round and you should go second on site after your jett, raze, neon or yoru.
> Worst of all are the people who spray the Odin through walls at the start of rounds

just don't peek into the spray. EZ
I'm always kind to bad players who I can see are trying their best. I'm an adult and like you sometimes the stress from adult life makes play like as if I'm jn the spectrum lol.

From what I can see from your post your real problem is stress OUTSIDE of Valorant, you just ventilated your stress in the game because it doesn't have real life consequences.
Focus on doing chill stuff, play when you're in a good head space ;*
It's very simple, do like me, play unrated, phuck the ranks
We sure about that?
He's a little below average, but in the optimal range which is 150-450 edpi. Your sens is pretty high for valorant at 880edpi
Maybe resist the urge to bring up irrelevant incidents as a way to justify sexism.

MeL is literally a pro Valorant player who was denied a spot on numerous tier one teams because she was a woman. That is bad, plain and simple.
Who cares if it's "bad", this clip is amazing
Weird downvotes here, we should def have the ability to turn aim assist off

Unless is already there and i just missed it
Best is just absolutely dominating a team on split defense after a shitty first half. We won like 8 straight rounds or something, I might have died one time. Kayo knife is busted if you can predict/guess a teams initial push with a little bit of consistency. 

Worst was Lotus also as Kayo. I was on a hot streak in comp games and it all just came crashing down. Couldn't hit shots, was falling for stupid baits and just making really dumb decisions. Game was still close and would have easily been a W if I played even close to my average. Felt like such shit.
Agreed. Spectre and Phantom skin put the rest to shame IMO
What if
Exactly what I think, I don’t watch him. Maybe an occasional video while I’m eating but the fact people are dissing him because he didn’t hit radiant is crazy. Look at who he has coached, what’s the success rate? Like honestly
It keeps me up at night wondering what happens when she ults an Iso just as he's ulting her at the same time
What I used to do in League, when I first hit gold solo queuing, is sort of "meditate" for like 5 mins. Just breathe in and out slowly, and mentally repeat some affirmations:

It's just a game. I am not my rank in a videogame. Etc... 

It helped me clear out the negative thoughts and let my skill and game sens come out. I don't do it as much lately but because I mastered the art of throwing away my RR 5 stacking with my iron 3 friends (im bronze 1/2). If i can get mvp and play solid, idc about the end result.

Smurfing isn’t anymore justifiable or reasonable when you’re a higher rank. Does not make it more sad that he’s gold…
Just because I don't use a mic I'm a bad guy?

K. So are you one of those guys who asks "does anybody have a mic" at agent select and then throws your mental if nobody answers, or what?

Honestly.

Like, I told you I ping and radio better than probably 95% of players use their mics. And mics are so effing overrated that it isn't even funny. People mostly just use them to demand heals (you can radio this btw), beg for skins, or be toxic. 

"Well how will I know where enemies are when my teammates see them?!" Radar. Look at your radar and appreciate that unless you wouldn't have time to process either radar or comms in making a decision, opponents can reposition rather quickly.

What else do you actually sincerely need? Are you going to draw up some complex exec over voice comms during buy time or just before a retake? That's absurdly unrealistic.

So what actually makes me a bad guy for not using my mic? What am I not doing?

I have never seen ANY positive correlation between my mic use and my winrate. Ever.

You know what's definitely correlated, though? People demanding voice comms and people who have bad mental games. I know this because I was one of them for a while until I realized how good Valorant's other features are WRT information. Seriously: Riot completely overshadows Valve with this stuff and nobody appreciates it AT ALL.

Sorry for jumping down your throat but I have no tolerance for people who conflate voice comms with teamplay. I'll take two teammates who know how to trade and push properly over four people who make callouts (wow, amazing; thanks for telling me what's on my radar and intelligible from gunshots; so valuable /s), every single time.
I'll try to ff in unrated whenever I can tell the match is completely unbalanced but I think early game it sometimes isn't necessary. I just don't feel like wasting my time with something that isn't even gonna help me improve
We play fortnite here, not battle royale.

&#x200B;

But i'll give you points for having either the balls or the ovaries so massive..... to post that here.
In this example they are being rude; but the one situation I could see someone being justified for boxing your teddy would be for chrome husks, if it was continually targeting/knocking them, the teammate might block it off so they could end the chrome with element. (But even then if there's still time on the bear's clock I will unbox it after)

No.

It does the cocoon thing fs it’s the only thing that makes sense. If u have 4s left why kill with ult?
Depends, there is always 1 collection per BP that has upgradables. I know someone who bought every BP but also bought all colour editions of all skins he unlocked in the BP and he was always pretty low on Radianite.

I havent bought a BP in a while because they have generally been quite low quality, but I have premium skins for most weapons but I only buy variants I like for each premium skin, rathern than just buying them all. So I have quite a bit of Radianite left over.

It’s always funny too 🤣
As a chamber main with 2k hours I’d hope it’s close to that
No point entering site to die straight away because nobody smoked, flashed, stunned, or did anything to give you a good position to entry
It boils down to your hidden elo compared to the others and your relative performance.

Basically if you fail many games in a row, and the game puts you against worse players and then you win, you won't get a lot of RR. Because you performed about the level game expects from you.

Similarly when you deliver a lot of times, and gsme puts you in a higher bracket, and even if you lose while still delivering, it won't take a lot of RR from you.


I think the basic idea is play to deliver and the game will place you about where you deserve. I'd say it does indeed value kills more, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. However it is not really a simple formula, that's for sure.
Im probably speaking out of my ass since I grinded it heavily back when i had a shitty setup in like 2017 but generally the game just felt less fluid compared to valorant which it might also have been because of strafing not being immediate like in valo
regardless, its their place more than mine to match-topfrag or to have more FB.
I’m waiting for more flux but I do have mega base Kyle so I use him when doing ssds
Nah — Canny. 

Canny Valley bro. That was one shitty ass grind.
Its unrated how are you going to accuse someone of smurfing in a mode which you cant even "smurf".
Like 5-10, plat 3
• Region: NA

• Type of Bug: Audio

• Description: I keep hearing random sound effects coming from nowhere. For example, hearing defusal/planting sounds when the bomb isn’t planted or being planted, or hearing the “choose your agent” voice line from the character selection screen on repeat in the middle of sounds

• Steps to Reproduce: I don’t know, it just started happening mid-game

• Expected Result: sounds match in-game events

• Observed Result: sounds not matching what’s happening in-game at all

• Reproduction Rate: constantly. It’s been 2 games now and the random sounds (mostly plant/defusal sounds and voice lines) keep playing randomly.

Tried restarting game twice and did not fix it.
Those guns aren’t useful in any way other than flexing it to the stonewood kids so they can get on their knees and beg you to trade for it. They may be “rare” but that’s only cause majority of the player base can see how those glitched perks are useless.
Where anywhere in your post did you say this was a price issue?
7 left then switch to gun and 1 shot.  So you know, you have your gun out already.  And if they aren't watching the wall crumble or able to hear the knife swings they might think you are just starting to shoot the wall instead of already broken through.
LOL
i never pickup a skin tbf
Can you post a screenshot when you see it?
its definitely butterflies lol
i don’t blame you, I’ve been playing less ranked as well. It feels a little pointless
[removed]
I bet if Iso gets buffed hes gonna be the opiest agent ever.
The guy literally just asked how many games people play per week. You can edit and rewrite your reply as many times as you want but it’s still irrelevant to the original post
Ill pay for a cod dm me
I’ve played iron lobbies for 4 years and I’ve never seen this done.
I had to quit csgo because of trust factor. My trust factor got so low because people thought I cheated and also reported me for being a girl. I would only get matched with actual blatant cheaters and match times would take several minutes once I waited 50 minutes and never found a game. I wasn’t actually that good at the game I just played with low ranked friends always so my rank never actually got up to what it was supposed to be. It was like I was smurfing but I wasn’t it was my main account. We would still lose even if I had like 40+ kills sometimes.

People are a lot nicer in valorant but, I still get people being toxic and throwing my games when I speak. So I hope they never add trust factor to valorant. I don’t want to play with assholes just because other assholes reported me for speaking.
Ya she definitely feels sorta good to play and sorta fun but definitely not lots.
Its all good, just admit hes a piece of shit and move on
I’m not saying that you’re lying, but how have you ran this ‘simple maths’ exactly. Having afk players 1 in every 3 games seems a bit exaggerated, I played like 8 games yesterday all between bronze 3 and gold 1 and didn’t have any AFK players. I played something like 150 games last act on an alt between bronze 3 - plat 1 and I could count on 1 hand how many AFKs I had. 100% of my games were on London servers and about 90% of them were either 3 stack or duo queue and the rest 5 stacks so obviously less chance of throwers in that 10%. But yeah more than anything genuinely curious how you ran the maths on over 10,000 games
DM taught me how to shoot. Swiftplay taught me how to play the game
mute, report, and move on
you don't have to be perfectly gifted mechanic/aiming to get a kill  
knowledge could give you a kill too  
if your knowledge don't give a kill or win round then it just not enough and lower weight ofc  
at basic level you should good enough to kill enemy while they distracted  
this is basic knowledge to get a kill  
enemy shooting your team then you should shoot back and get a kill back too  
it isn't always 1v1 duel  
if you team get killing and someone keep hiding, let enemy get free multiple 1v1 and lose to them then they deserve lose  
you play cypher and have trap setup, can use cam trap and get a kill too  
if you still can't get kill with those and blame role then it's your bad, not role bad

and lol how can you say cs util don't matter  
it's as well as important as val, arguable more important  
it just a lot harder to utilize util in cs than in val. it need to be communicate well and right timing when use  
smoke need more line up and take time to throw/pop, while val smoke is just point click  
cs lower rank aren't good with it and end up just do raw gunfight
Clove is from Edinburgh. I am from Edinburgh. They are the entire reason I started playing due to that fact
i got no games or anything it’s just clips but idk how to perm delete them.
Then why dont any big streamers or pros ever say this? You never hear Tarik , Tenz or s0m say this game had any sort of cheating issue. Now compare that to games with actual cheating problems like Warzone or CS. You have entire channels dedicated to catching cheaters in those games.
thing about valorant is that there are wayyy too many different variables that it becomes impossible, for example u could do a good play but the enemy's mechanics punish you still, and after u die u would think it's bad play but it was actually good
Nah, it helps sometimes but not enough to matter. I find having a mike to be more of a fun thing
Valorant is the least demanding fps game out there. You can run Valorant on a potato...
Np :D Good luck!
You don't realise how rich af riot is lmao.
Ok so i also came form Overwatch although i must say i was nothing special (i think i peeked plat or something) anyways i found it really hard to win gunfights in Valorant aswell for a while and was stuck in around gold 1-plat 1 range (im now asc 2). 

So what should you do to improve overall aim?   In your case doing something like DM or TDM could help since those force out a lot of 50/50 situations where you peek someone and they peek you at the same time. So doing those after just warming up in aimlabs or the range really quickly could help.

Movement wise since you said you watched a lot of videos imma assume you know how to peek. Like double inputs while doing it, W and D or S at the same time, taking 2 steps to peek and stuff like that. So the things to focus on more would be making everything a conscious decision or atleast making sure your "gunfight hygiene" is good. When you are going to peek these are things i consider/do before peeking . You need to have a reason to peek (info, get a quick and EASY kill, double swing with teammate, etc) . You need to actually prepare yourself to peek (just mentally noting to yourself  "hey imma peek this now") and then actually peeking properly. Obviously some time those steps need to happen  fast and you just kinda do it but the more you can make it a choice and not a reaction atleast for me helps a lot. 

Also just a small pointer. Those gunfights you dont count are what most of kills should be. Catching timings on people and just outplaying them is way better than simply peeking them and hoping to just be better. Of course some roles take more 50/50 and stuff but the point still stands.

Hope this helps although i managed to confuse myself a bit with my own message lol. If you want me to be more specific with some of that feel free to ask!
Who do you play? If you were s3/g1 you must've had inflated rr if you're struggling in bronze. I would say just get better aim then the silvers and learn to read their tendencies. I went from starting in Iron to g3 before a long hiatus. I learned omen, played lots of dm, and just played with no respect for enemy team until they show they're competent. 

&nbsp;

Bronze/Silvers are extremely bad with util and rarely play info initiators so if they're a whole bunch of duelists then play the rattiest off angles u can think of and mow them down. Lots of low elo will ping pong from a to b site if they get stuffed, so don't just auto pilot one site. On attack just use util smartly to clear angles and let ur teammates go in and trade them. If you find an enemies weak site exploit it until they prove they can counter you
so diamond on console is bronze on pc, interesting
But is more exploitative? Take raze for example. She’s easily punished if you’re able to catch her when she’s landing after satcheling. Now imagine you see a raze land after satcheling, and then she instantly tumble roles into cover. 

The issue with adding more movement mechanics into the game is it takes away from other agent’s niches. Again, why jett op if i can viper op and tumble away? Why neon slide if i can side step? Obviously it’s bc the original ability would be “better” but it’s still doable for every other agent now. 

I think you’re focusing too much on the shooter portion of TACTICAL SHOOTER. The advantage in gunfights comes from the kit of the agent and how you use it. This includes movement and non movement utility.

This is the most hardstuck iron for 3 years take ive ever heard. My brother in christ its a team shooter. Not a single player game. Your supposed to help each other like, baiting when your low hp, trading, swinging off eachother, buying weapons for each other.
# 1984

fr though, they likely accidently rerolled the missions since all missions changed. I wouldn't worry about them lowering V-Buck missions unless this becomes a consistent trend.
Not everything gonna be fair. Cry about it
so my question then is does it make me a smurf if i’m playing with friends that are lower ranked than i am?
^(me too especially since I like the Guardian)
I'm getting a headache waiting for this
to respond to the quote at the end, how is me trading my teammate and or swinging with my teammate to kill an iso cope? everyone is saying he is op because he is non stop snow balling kills. if he’s only good for 1 kill that isn’t op.

This happened like 8 years ago
I don't really do endurance so trap durability is meh to me, but also from 8 squads with each having 16% hero ability damage I dont think the 256% is significant.

And my main point is, even though I sadly knew it was additive, does the bonus not show up in stats at all (only trap durability)? Because when I get rid of that bonus I can still not see the difference
Good lord there are children on this sub. Please use the term “Fr*nch”.

Okay I'm sorry for saying this but you've got to suck it up. Not as in "stop whining", what I mean is the community needs people like you. The girls who speak up. You'd be surprised how many women play valorant, and you'd only be surprised because they never talk. Be the one who does. Make the rest feel safe. Because if every woman playing valorant would make use of comms, people who throw when they've got one on their team will have a near 0% winrate. You can force the change by taking a stand. I could also give some advice to dissolve toxicity, if you'd like. Just things I've figured out on my own.
I really don’t think ppl pay enough attention or understand smurfing enough. The very first game my buddy played with me he got an ace. He plays shit like rocket league and LOL. not a shooter player at all. We’re playing for the king as we speak lol. People have pop off games. 10 people in a lobby of nearly equal skill is 10 chances for someone to have an insane game. Y’all need to check yourselves before you turn into the cod bros that excuse every single person they down to as a hacker. I’ve been called a Smurf every single time I’ve had a good game where I went between like 1.5-2.0 K/d.
Just play to enjoy. That's the main reason for playing. I've played America's Army, Black Squad and Warzone for decades and I still suck. Although the odd time I even surprise myself. It's not if you win or lose as long as you try.
I haven’t even gotten ISO in my agent pool yet (he’s not showing) and I wanted to try him in the range.
Thanks for the advice man, what would you recommend me to do to gain elo?

The opt-out is for arbitration. Ultimately they will just have to log the accts that submitted letters to opt-out should there be any future class action lawsuits. It's highly advisable to send the letter certified with account ID # and in game name for your own records.  But yes, if you ultimately refuse to agree to the new terms for use, you will forfeit your access to the game. This, in and of itself seems to be a violation of business ethics as they are goods and services that were obtained in exchange for monies paid (skins, etc.); however, it was always denoted in the end user agreement that terms are subject to change and access to the game is strictly reliant on the end user agreeing to the terms as they see fit.  Bottom line, they have lost a ton of money & are sick of it & want to ensure that if there is future litigation, they won't have a huge number of accounts to pay out to because the majority won't bother to provide an opt-out document.
Never judge players based on their highlights
I assume aimbots are easier to detect and see that they're cheating. I feel like people just usually wall hacks is more common. Other team would just think you have a fast reaction time and good luck. Plus it's easy enough to play dumb and hide it. Just peak the wrong corner every now and then
My friend introduced me to valorant and told me to play sage and heal him. I got 0 kills and shot my gun probably 2 or 3 times the whole game. 
Now i’m a higher rank than he is
it worked, Thanks
There’s also a crate with balloons that fly to the sky in the beginning of the game
i’m talking to friends i’ll comm in vc but i’m not making small talk
20 hz monitor exists? 😭
I rarely instalock, but sometimes I do it because I'm fed up with people telling me what to play. They want to play their Raze, their Reyna, or whatever, and they say "smokes pls". I'm perfectly fine with the fact that they play what they want. But I don't want to be the one feeling like the bad guy because I was the last one to lock and not to pick the smoker we could have needed.

So, sometimes, I will instalock just not to have to deal with these people. And I suppose you are part of these people. If you want a role in your team: play it. It's exceptionally rare that 3 or more people instalock a role. The vast majority of my games have a decent comp, with flashes, smokes, sentinels, vision, etc. And sometimes, there will be an instalocker who will instalock my main agent. But it's fine, I can play something else sometimes.

Nope, not at all. I don’t use my base for endurance anymore, it’s pretty much my personal metal storage.
Yes this. I was playing unrated and I play Fade.

I always used my util and then peek.

But one of my team mates peek before I use my skill

Then he said that I should not wait for him to peek
For me best will be Prime and worst will be Champion like come on even if it's exclusive It's way costlier than it should have been just because a champion stricker? Nah hell no I ain't paying for that

Nobody knew these were directional until Mitch Robbs put out a video!  We all used them wrong for years!  

But to be fair,  Epic didn't even give us any hints that this trap and some others were directional with how they work instead they just simple placed "Drops a payload of tires from up to 3 tiles high."  in the traps description and was done with it.
That is fair, I am a casual player and tend to preach play who you're most comfortable with. I'm not saying choose the worst option, but also I'm trying to say that I'd rather have a good sage then a bad Cypher or KJ, personally that is.
Hes asking for your rank. Which doesnt matter to the argument, hes just trying to boost his ego by saying hes a higher rank then whatever you say.
The main issue is that the toggle shield lasts too long so it gets too much value. They need to reduce the toggle shield duration to only be a few seconds so that it wears off before the barriers of the iso ult go down and only a couple of spots can get peeked with the protection up.
Okay my bad, I didn't know about this. Thanks

Terrible micro adjustments. I've somewhat learned when to do which peeks from watching coaching vids.
Still not good at taking my time with shots. My aim is probably like that of a low diamond.

I play brimstone so I don't really take a lot of gunfights. I just play lineups, do double peeks and play close to my teammates during post plants for kills. I just call strats based on how the enemy reacts to executes. Overall usually very supportive type plays to make my team look better rather than myself.

Ofc one issue is that I took a long break after hitting D2 and didn't play much afterwards. Now I just watch pro vods and vod reviews.

I usually warmup with two or three deathmatchs before ranked. I play like 3-4 ranked matches and call it a day.

Don't really do self vod reviews which I assume I should since it'd help.

I think one area that'd help to improve is how I can use mollies on attack aside from playing post plant.

I'm somewhat versed with the win criteria for maps like Bind, Split and Lotus because I watch some Woohoojin vods.

I recall hearing people say to focus on gamesense but tbh my mechanics are a bit lackluster compared to the average person in my lobby.

I might do better if I played ranked more frequently but here's my tracker https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/ReyeRay%23JJK/overview
We were on ascent and enemy was only pushing B so Reyna and skye would go mid from market raze and brim went from B main to pin and I set up on B site bot at B main and turret either at market stairs looking out towards main or defense spawn hall. So I would be right there while the were fighting I’d shoot a couple shots if they were able to push out into main but sometimes they’d send one person flank from A to defender’s spawn so I was watching for that also. I wasn’t just sitting like back site waiting for them to kill my team or be able to sneak on, I was just hanging back 

This is a little excessive lol but

https://imgur.com/a/sFRTKRo

The enemy went here like 97% of the time. If they happened to actually go B main Reyna Skye would go in through market and I’d go defense hall to site since I still had my bot at B main door I’d know if they pushed in before I made it to the opening across from where they’re coming in.
It counts health reduced by her ult, I’m pretty sure.

Your damage sounds like a server problem though.
A bug going on for months now
yeah, you got my tracker you can add me when you feel like it
I thought he might’ve been saying 3 kd was bad for some reason lol
Wow. Someone enjoyed ventures I think
The way you're talking reminds me of a Kay-O player I ran into who insisted his previous teams had been toxic assholes but then proceeded to say we were throwing (at a +3 lead) before muting us all, whinging to the enemy team and refusing to play the game.


He couldn't see that he was the problem. I wager you're similarly giving us half a story.
Yeah definitely good advice and totally agree. I’d say this is mostly a hobby for fun as a creative outlet for me, but also I haven’t hit radiant, only immortal. Not to say immortal isn’t good but not sure if it has the same punch that radiant does?
Hs percentage does not matter at all. Damage/kills to deaths and assists matter more. Even this is rank dependent. If you are stuck then that’s probably because you are losing fights to higher rank players while your stats may be padded by winning against lower rank.
OK thank you guys ! 😍
If you ever need help, add Pjaryd

first thing i turn off in any game is motion blur
i agree. also breach if you like to be annoying

Thank you for the tips! I will certainly try to do my best! :)
Just tap or burst, dont spray

Maybe she was playing another game at the same time , dont blame her
I just tried it again for myself and it works. If you are sure that POST is selected, make sure the URL is correct and all the other details. (no spaces in front or behind, no line breaks etc)

Otherwise i could only help if u would stream it or something. The error message doesnt tell me more sadly.
They should make it so you lose 15% less rr per afk or disconnected player or if you win then you get 10% more rr per player. Or something along those lines
You went through old comments to find this? Also when did they add fracture and pearl back? So you weren’t right?
If you sign up to he a tester and you get selected, you’ll have access to it.
Funny
Everyone’s talking about the ones getting banned but no one’s talking about the many that aren’t since the beta launched I’ve played with multiple people who have admitted to ximming and not one has been punished just today I got matched onto a team with a 3 stack all talking about how they’ve been ximming the past 3 days fine without issue
D3 here(i keep scraping near ass rank), sadly nope there's a lot of weird ppl across every rank
The rank reset this act is actually fucked up. I peaked ascendant 2, was ascendant 1 the last episode, and got placed placed in plat 1. The games i've been getting are either where I'm placed with actual plats and diamonds, or with people who are peak immortals and ascendants. I go either 35/10 or 16/18. I'm not even able to get back up to diamond right now, it's infuriating.

Is dodging allowed? 😂
Valorant skins were always at least double the price they are worth so nothing new, just skip them in my opinion.
Same issue. Updated nvidia graphics card using Nvidia Geforce app. And rebooted system. Then it didn't crash anymore. I'm still using DX12.
Honestly, just work on the fundamentals of the game. Crosshair placement, strafe, etc. There is a [pretty good playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_JPXMBzXj4) for the banana man himself Woohoojin that are perfect for beginners (check Novice playlist).

About agents, honestly, just play the agents that you like, confidence is important as aim and technique, if you are playing an agent that you are not comfortable, you will play worse no matter how good your aim is.  If your fundamentals are good enough, you will rank up anyway.

From Iron to Bronze 1 and 2 is nearly no difference, just work on your movement and keep playing and you will rank up at some time.
Shit like this always happens


Womp womp I guess( kinda scummy but there's plenty other youtuber doing similar things)
I just make fun of them and try to make them feel stupid
I'm sorry but there's no over power teddy load out in the 140 zones and 160 zones there useless and most outlanders dont help
Over 1000$ USD😅😅
Sova on Pearl with a bulldog. valo is my first fps so that was def memorable even though its just one of those simple clutches that aren't considered "clippable". Even now i still use a bulldog when i have bad games w no aim and suddenly i start getting kills lmao.
Smurfing is a major issue that seriously needs to be addressed. 

Valorant needs to either force authenticate with phone numbers. Or widen the margins for people to be able to queue together. 

I'm silver right now because I haven't played in a very long time. 

I can queue 5 stack with my friends into full plat/diamond lobbies and be frag out just fine. 

However my friend will play on an alt account (yes I know this is the exact problem I'm bitching about) and the enemy team will eithor have no chance, or a radiant Smurf playing with his silver friend. The games are never balanced.

And again I get it, people want to play with there friends. What kind of sociopath wants to soloqueue this game? 

But right now bronze-plat lobbies are just plagued with alt accounts.
Do you stream buddy? Bcz i have a feeling ik you for some reason!
> normal, just wait 2-3 updates
lmfao once won a game on OT this way, except it was Haven and a Skye that decided it was a bright idea to hop out of heaven while low health
How can someone "smurf" in Swiftplay to boost new accounts to play Competitive? That doesn't make sense. If you said botting in order to level up accounts, that would make more sense.
If you want to see how to get kills with her ult, I recommend you watch any game with miniboo on neon.
Xbox app
well, you dont have to worry about perks that early in the game. Later on in Canny and Twine it becomes important to get good perks. It depends on the playstyle or the way you want to use a weapon, either matching the perks to work with an specific hero loadout, or giving it perks to work well regardless of hero loadout. Still you should know that (in most of the times) Crit perks rolls outperform damage perk rolls. You will mostly see people recommending using 1 Crit Rating and 2 Crit Damage perks over Full damage perks
Relax, do not worry. I also made sketches for a long time and little by little I tried to improve some techniques of how I wanted my drawings to look good.
Duno but its hella cringe, feel bad for the ladies that use mic tbh
Thanks but i farn a lot and dont really need to worry about materals and dont really like melee weapons
Welp, never share your account.
Over there!
That seems like it would discourage a lot of people from playing ranked
A 13-0 is so satisfying, you get so much rr for stomping
Yes! And then 3v5 because iso has the shield again and one more vulnerability
Really you missed nothing, miss when agents would release every act
Yes the spray. Exactly around the head lol
I was his friend and i was in 7 of his videos. He stopped uploading because he just doesnt get views anymore. He removed all his videos and now his channel just sits there while he plays other games

i try to be engaging ingame right from agent select but then again there are people who are just... angry by nature
i was iron 2 for 1.5 years lmao. was a laptop wifi gamer. my bf built me a pc and i have a wired connection now, took maybe a couple games and i double ranked up to silver 2. silver 3 now and counting lol
Did you not read the first 2 sentences?

That's why I said to either bring the duration of the wall down so it doesn't stay up nearly as long... OR to bring the hp of the wall down to where Utility can break the wall... 

I'm not saying leave it as is and then just make it one way for her. Make adjustments to give it counterplay. Ergo utility being able to break the wall or the make it have a shorter duration time while up.
Eh, its already basically like a higher skill check raze ult with more of a chance for enemies to dodge it or save their teammates. And Raze can easily get all 5 if they obligingly bunch up for her. 

I think being able to get at least two (but maybe slightly shrinking the capture sphere after the rebound to compensate) would be a nice change. 

Still doesn't address the rest of Deadlocks kit being hot garbage though

Good job acting only made it past wave one in challenge 5
Usually if you get shot you just die or fall over so I feel like being able to still move is pretty good
I find it hilarious valorant doesnt have a replay system yet. Where you can download vods of your game and watch it. Even league has this. The fact that you have to use 3rd party programs. And i know people we go JUST GET MEDAL HEE HAW. But having a proper replay system like league, OW, CS you can slow things down, see things from other peoples POV, "oh he can see me from that angle that seems to be a one way" "oh thats how he knew i was there my team mate missed step" you can slow it down, speed it up, time stamps. One day guys. Like how league will have voice comms, valo will have a replay system.
oh i gotcha. my fault
Be quiet was the worst
I mean cypher's cage can be nice
Why did bro get downvoted for saying “ok” 😭
who plays swiftplay to socialise 💀
I am a CS player who started playing valo when the only way to play it was through watching twitch streams and wait for a key. I really enjoyed valorant and played nonstop for weeks. My friends didnt like the game that much so i was the only one left playing. 

Then they released icebox, breeze, new agents, etc. I found the maps to be lacking and some agents to be very frustrating to play against, besides, i thought some situations i was put in literally had no counterplay at all. I slowly started to give up on the game as i slowly was getting hooked on CSGO again. Sometimes I still get the itch to play valorant and see if I enjoy it again, but im so out of the loop with everything it becomes even more frustrating to play, and i dont have the time to keep up with the meta and such.

nah i disagree, with the old contracts you didn't need to do anything other than set the contract and play the game. you could just forget about it. with kingdom creds and the max of 10k, you can't do that. you have to grind and then choose what you want one item at a time.
I have played a lot of games and riot is by far the best studio when it comes to making the game better for the community
Every game I play had an instalocking duelist that can't entry anyway, at least there's a variation of voice lines now
I wonder if it's stupidity or just straight up being shit,

but I am just doing my part as player of this game and addressing the issue to where it should be addressed.
Sage res
On pc i think neon mains are respected far more than a majority of the agents
nice one!
On the one hand, I don't want them to remove because:  
1. It is a relatively unique mission compared to other STW missions, it'd be a shame to lose it.  
2. It may set a precedent for the dev team to just remove missions if they stop working.   


But on the other hand:   
1. I can't remember the last time I successfully completed a DTB mission because IT BREAKS ALL THE TIME. Especially on all the biomes they've added in the past 3 years or so (Tropical, mushroom, etc).  


From what we've seen with STW updates in the past year or so, it seems the devs main priority is to fix bugs and develop one significant feature at a time. E.g. We got animals, then we got movement, then we got new biomes, then a reworked event gamemode and so on. With this, I kind of hope the team will eventually look at fixing/ reworking old mission types (And maybe even developing new ones afterwards).
capitalism at it's finest...
I think Cypher is pretty overpowered once you know how to use em. Don’t tag the enemy with the camera tag, use map warning tag that enemies don’t see. Hide the camera well and watch both sites alone.

lotus is very different when you include flanking in your strats
Yeah the 2 other guys holding the site arnt getting out without help from the other 3 who are searching for me in my cypher cage, so atleast 1 die to my 4 guys rushing the site. So 4v4 retake with a free site is pretty good. And there is also a good chance that I can get 1 and die if they push 3 guys towards me.
Bug with Omen and Deadlock ult right now. Hitting him with it as he TPs away instantly kills him and removes the Spike from the map if he's carrying it. It also spikes your ACS for no apparent reason.
If you want a game where you work together, buy Fortnite. You’re moaning that the free PvP spinoff has in-fighting?


Excuse me waiter, my gazpacho soup has been served cold
It takes a deep breath to recollect. We’ve been sweeped in literal seconds before. I remember that if I go quiet, there may not be a plan this round. Sometimes we laugh it off as a team. Other times, someone else on the team will suggest a plan, and I’ll treat it as the best plan ever, let people know that you trust their ideas.

 IGL in soloQ is not the same as VCT or pro play. You can’t tell people what to do with their abilities at every point during the match. You can ask for one or two abilities at start of round, maybe a re-smoke during a site take. After that? Give your team agency. Let them play their game, and they feel comfortable enough to make some great plays.
Honestly if I were you I would do 1 of 2 things:

1. Clearly explain to them that I want to rank up and I am doing background work and practice to do so. i have a goal to reach Diamond and that takes effort. If they are not aligned, do they mind playing unrated from now on and having fun.

2. Create a second account to play Competitive with them on. And use my main account to rank up in SoloQ. Obviously if you get much better that’s consider smurfing which is not encouraged but I find that Bronze to Gold is basically the same.

This may sour the relationship with your friends, so I would evaluate is ranking up that important for me. And if you find that you wont get happy unless you give it your best shot, then by all means do it.
yeah, unbinding crouch is like treating g the symptom instead of the problem.  plus you want to be able to crouch, you just have to learn when it's good.  in bronze, it's usually better to not, but still good to have the option.
Just in case, check out the upcoming champions knife, it has some really cool animations and the whole bundle might be worth it with the phantom
Cypher is definitely going to have a slightly higher pickrate, but KJ is still gonna be more picked simply because it takes more skill to get the most out of cyphers kit
I agree. They should advertise that's it's not playable in STW. 

I have a Ciri skin (that was gifted to me) I can't use it as it makes my frame rate drop to nothing and I become unplayable. Apparently his is a known issue but they refuse to refund., even though they essentially sold a broken item.

Epic sucks sometimes.
[removed]
Ok yeah but its not like Every. Single. Game. I just recently came back to the game few months ago and my experience is that the 160s have the players that do the most.
I know xenohunter is so bad
Well if you're using a patronizing tone of voice when giving constructive criticism while at the same time not playing as well as your teammates that could potentially irk people to the point where they roll their eyes at you and ignore any type of "tip" or "correction" you're giving. How about focusing on what you could do better or communicate your intentions on a site take rather than focusing on another player while at the same time backseat gaming. When you sit around focusing on another player rather than yourself that could also come off as pompous and annoying AF to some people.
Still, Brim's molly kills in 2-3 secs, Vipers's one in 6.5 seconds
I don't care for a map choosing option. It's one of those features that makes a game more stale over time. It also doesn't make sense with all the agents in the game imo to limit the maps. 

And yes, I enjoy pretty much every map. Haven is one of my least favourites and I've always liked Icebox. Generally I understand giving flexibility for the players is a good thing, but sometimes it can make the experience worse imo and influence what the overall experience becomes like. I don't really like it in CS either, even when there are more maps I dislike in that game.
Try recording your gameplay and checking how long your Crosshair is not in a valid position (headheight back wall), no diagonal peaks
Valorant is my first FPS. I couldn’t tell you how long it took me to understand the fundamentals in hours, but I’d say give or take 6 months to a year to be in silver/gold. I was stuck in gold for awhile but once I got the hang of everything beyond just the basics, I went from gold to diamond/low-mid ascendant pretty quickly.

I’ve never followed any coaching videos/threads or routines and just kind of learned with experience. By no means do I consider myself good at the game, but I’m definitely a lot better than I was! So I’m sure with extra efforts and actually playing the game to learn (for a while I didn’t play with any intent of actually understanding the game) it could definitely help someone’s progress! Watch videos, read up on tips, and play the game! Actually playing, practicing, and implementing what you’ve learned is what will probably help the most.

One other thing I found that helps me is watching streamers (usually pros) who play agents I like and seeing how they play them. Kinda helps you understand the agents toolkit a bit more.
Cause it’s like 3am or some shit when I’m typin bro and nobody’s gonna make me feel bad about misgenderjng a damn video game character bro people yelling at me for accidentally saying she way to much I’m trying man just give me time
I have, just wondering if he could be a (fortnite) ninja with that krypton sword.
but he dones't undres
Yall are owed a deeper explanation on this, but the short version is that:

* Replication saw very low player numbers, to the point of queue health concerns (players waiting in queue for long periods of time OR playing in pretty lopsided/unbalanced matches). There just weren't that many people who played it, even if it might not feel that way for folks who loved it.
* Replication takes a non-negligible amount of work for us to maintain, given the unique nature of the bugs it can create with all the interactions there. It creates a little pocket of special issues we have to address that are only relevant in Replication, whereas most of our bugs permeate across many of our modes (meaning when you fix them, you're improving the experience in lots of different places)
* Replication also is difficult to maintain in terms of performance, with some players in some scenarios (for example, 10 vipers) in our minimum spec machines falling to really low FPS thresholds or generally having a bad experience
* Replication is also an overhead for our agent designers when building new agents; it takes a decent amount of work to figure out interactions between all the agents and how they'll work to get things to not break and it slows down our development process for making new things

When you put all of those things together, and very few players are playing the mode, we've opted to set it down for now. It's not off the table that we could bring it back in the future, but we'd need to find a way to solve these problems, and right now it feels like we have bigger things to prioritize to keep the game healthy.
I think the beta will last until the end of the new season.
Even as a man I get kinda stressed out when a girl starts speaking in vc because I fear someone in the team is about to get extremely creepy
ALL ABOARD THE PAIN TRAIN!!!!
Would love one
diamonds
I think it's half intended and would probably be left as is even if STW had its full development team. They'll absolutely go after me and never let me go if i don't clear the whole area, but I think the husks retarget the animals because the animal AI aggros when they see the husks moving and the husk just hits first as the animal AI attacks based on proximity while the husks is just based on presence
The moment the enemy or a teammate types or says anything negative, mute. Mute mute mute. Thats all you can do, if you get tilted, focus on your own mental health before video games. Turn on a blue light filter, cut doen on sugar and caffiene, meditate, whatever you need to do to be comfortable and play the best of your abilities, these things happen
Went from Imm1 to D3 this act with maybe 3 wins in between.
I dont really remember but i know it took less than an act to get b1
I stand corrected.
Deadlock is primarily a defense sided character. play for spike holds, Use her barrier to force enemies to go to other areas and maintain area control with her as that is her biggest strength. Sentinel roll is a more backline character, you're the backbone, the last defense of  a team and you use your abilities to help manage your team like preventing flanks or using you abilities to more directly support your team.
Dm is the worst to judge ranks, I see silver/golds shitting on high elo PPL in DM but doing nothing in actual games
I presume they mean an actual robot or script running with no human behind the screen
clicking head and crosshair placement are different things imo
I swear this is literally how every single game with a ranked system works, it never puts you at the same rank you were- always a lot lower.
the only significant distinction between the siegebreaker and wraith is that the wraith comes with higher base crit values and better perk availability for a 1cr 2cd build. the whole point of the wraith is that its basically the same gun but it does crits better.

A class action suit needs at least 7 people.

I actually disagree that as viper you shouldn't have spike because you shouldn't be lurking as a viper and good viper players play post plant which means you should be planting for a lineup you are guaranteed to know.

You're also not going to be going in second or first so if you don't plant you're essentially doing nothing other than lining up wall or smoke which are both very quick.

The only players that shouldn't take spike are people heavy lurking away from the bombsite or hard entry that are going to focus on taking space on site.

I got twitch connect to tracker but it has no info and the username random. And the name in valorant i use it only there nowhere else.
Still mad that there’s no discount for STW owners (or even founders). Also this could’ve EASILY been a quest reward from like survive the horde
yes pls
Or realize you are farming with an actual sword instead of a pickaxe, It feels so wrong.
Problem with that is what do you make the 5th spot? If you let it be a flex why would anyone ever queue for anything else?
It's more like we go each other pretty frequently so ya.
Yes.
I reached Immortal in the first season I played this game, so I think in this game, A better Preemptive-Aim can at least get you to Ascendant. Followed by that, the rest (Immortal , Radiant) is all about aiming and reaction time or gift...
Cheating is not hard if you want to cheat, even with vanguard. 
CS2 is infested with it, and so it might be possibly bleeding over to valorant. 
Lots of new people become cheaters there, because they can't stand other cheaters having an advantage all the time. They get hooked on cheating and go to other games, to "have fun". 
I've seen lots of cheaters who were trying badly to hide it lately. Only two red screens in the past 2 months. 
You can look up the stats of people being banned for cheats each month as well, it's been posted by Riot. The numbers seem to be only going up each month (not the total, but each month). So, yeah, you might be just unlucky.
I feel the same. I try to win until it's really over. No matter if it is 0-12, 12-12 or 16-16

Sounds like LS
Buying the bundle doesn't take being a whale. It takes one bad financial decision.
Essentially it's usually a solo holder, either the sentinel or controller (Vipers especially). If a sage or deadlock walls it, you push anyway.

Higher elo duelists will sometimes hold C as well and fast flank. Possibly ego peek off rip as well.
Yeah all my friends are adults that can afford it. It’s still a lot of money.
says you arent accepting friend requests
For real, needs to be addressed
it'd be less interesting if you gave everyone a dash or satchel like ability though to make them as viable as jett forcibly, there would literally just be blue jett, black jett, purple jett etc if you just gave everyone movement abilities similar to them 

you also have more in phoenixs kit to use other than wall, no one picks him for his wall lets be real its for his ult that you can spam, everything else is a bonus
Yeah I don't know how to tell you this one but lag spikes are not the games fault lol.
step 1 : mute  
step 2 : report (I got 2 guys penalised, got a notification, sometime it works, sometime it doesnt)  
step 3 : learn if you did something wrong  
step 4 : play next match 

life is too short to argue, just say \_ and move on bhai
Please don’t do that
Epic love giving us things we dont want lol
just a reminder to not be dumb and chase frags etc.

I hate bigger melees, I think they look weird + where does my viper whip out that axe from??? what is an axe doing on a modern day battlefield??

I’m peak silver 2 and haven’t played in almost 6 months. I come back the past 2 weeks and play about 15 comp games in that time. All my lobbies are a mixture of silvers, golds, plats, and diamonds. Whoever wins comes down to who has the diamond on their team. Or in some cases they get 2 diamonds.
i probably should have specified this but i see which TEAM has the most kills, not the individual. And also I do it like that because that’s just how my brain works

It being dependent on external factors is also part of your mentality.

Lol find a squad
redneck with delusions of grandeur, bahaha!
I say this will all due genuinely respect, if you feel these characters are purely based on cheesy abilities, it’s a skill issue. 

Just to start with the easiest example, Neon is a total non threat while she’s running. If she’s also using a shotgun, sure I’ll give it to you she’s more dangerous, but again this can be easily avoided with better positioning and awareness since you’ll hear her running towards you like a freight train if this is the case.

Yoru is possibly the most skill based agent in the entire game to do well with. He’s very easy to fuck up with and waste utility if you don’t know what you are doing, and also still easy enough to counter if you adapt to playing against a Yoru specifically rather than just doing what you normally do. 

Omen I’m just kinda confused about. You can make a shotgun play in a smoke with any agent who has access to them. 

As for the ults? Yeah, the entire premise is that they’re powerful. Why would I want my ultimate to be on the same impact level as a wet fart. Ults should have the capability to have large impact on a round. Why bring up these ults as being cheap or chessy specially? 

Raze, Deadlock and Gekko ults are basically guaranteed kills if you use them intelligently, Viper has a near guaranteed defence win on a site, similar story for KJ on attack, Sage literally just takes a pick away from the other team - point is you could make the same argument for almost every ult in the game. They’re meant to be good, allowing for some sort of very powerful win condition in a certain scenario.
Which epic lacks the capability of
I agree with the statement that the only thing that matters is having fun, but saying rank only matters if you’re going pro is crazy, the difference between the game you play in low elo vs high elo is incomparable

Would be cool if they Added “Play with Others” mission option to Ventures and play all PL zones.

I can solo ventures… but it’d be so much better with more people.
my daughter started to play valorant, we played many rounds together until she played more and more often in her circle of friends. once then she invited me to play with her friends. they were totally surprised: "who are you?" "is that really your father?" they asked again and again. then i picked Killjoy and everyone was like "what!? you have to pick breach or Brim as a dad!" we laughed so hard :D that was great! the round was also great.   
since then i have never played with her and her circle of friends again. she is in adolescence/puberty and i don't think i should interfere in her circle of friends.   
but the fact that i was able to play with her in her circle of friends once was one of the best experiences of my life.

It’s not infinite, it has a cooldown and can only be used a very small number of times after death. As in 1-2 smokes.

yeah the game thinks you belong in a much higher rank. It’ll stay until the your mmr levels out with your visible rank. I imagine that would be Diamond ish. 

You can tell your visible rank matches your mmr when you’re getting +18 per win and losing about the same or a little more (-21) on average.
They’ll still sometimes refund if you used it. I bought a skin that ended up looking like crap in game and they refunded it.
No, I keep climbing every act pretty much, I think I can make diamond this act, last act I hit plat.
1.2 K/D in Plat1. 

I'm pretty pleased with the positive K/D though I would've liked to climb to Plat2. Unfortunately, I think I might've reached my ceiling as I have difficulty playing in high Plat lobbies. Oh well. 

On the bright side, I placed Bronze 3 in E8 A1 and was able to climb up to Gold in that act (double ranked up from S1 to S3 helped). So getting to Plat is a pretty nice achievement especially when I thought Gold was already my peak.

First off… look up a pro by the name of Nats playing Viper. 

He will show you good setups by default but will also show you how a good Viper plays off their team. 

I’ll be honest, sometimes you get stuck without your wall OR orb (can’t pick it up or whatever) and all you may have is a couple mollies and your gun to help you retake. That’s fine. It’s usually better than saving your wall for retake (on defense). Whenever you can, pick up your orb to help with retake. It’s really good. 

As a controller or sentinel (which Viper sometimes operates more like a senti) you naturally will be a late rotator quite often. Being able to talk with your team on the other site as to when the other team is executing so you can rotate, for sure, is key. You definitely don’t want to rotate too early, in case of a fake and pivot back to your site. That’s just true with most controllers and sentinels. 

You’ll see Nats and other controller/senti pros stuck in solo retakes quite a bit because, well, they are doing their job and their teammates can’t hold a site the entire half. It’s just how the role plays.
You can rank up with any agent, any playstyle will work. The most important thing is to play any agent you enjoy. Your personal preference with the agent is the only thing that really matters.
KAST shows how much of a valuable teammate you are and how good you are performing for your team.

KDA depends. You can have a high amount of kills but 0 impact when you bait your teammates and farm enemies who thought they got everyone or you‘re just farming exit or eco frags. I have a friend who plays chamber, has almost every match a very high amount of kills but just does all of the low impact frags I just stated above.

But on the other hand you should definitely aim for a good KDA (depends on the role but to sum it up it should be somewhere around 1.5 - Flasher probably more than that)
>They don't care about us Founders, they already got our money.

They don't "don't care" about founders, you/we are giant walking ads for Fortnite skins, they give us free vbucks so we buy skins and advertise the shit out of it so others buy it with real money.

I am silver1. I am inconsistent AS HELL. Every game I could pop off or I could bottom frag and feel useless.
That’s really interesting and probably means you played too defensive before because clove is an agent that will drag down your KD/A by default considering every 3-4 rounds she gets the chance to die twice.

I don't mean peak as a lifetime achievement, I mean what you can do right now. 

If you only play two matches a day because that's all you can do while at 100% then you're going to miss a lot of valuable practice when at 80%-90%.

If you run one sprint a day then you're going to do better than someone who trains harder and longer because they will be tired. But a month later the person who is training harder will be faster than the person who just records their sprint every day and then goes home to rest.

Hi I Olay on the Singapore server, and I can tell you this; yes they are good but also not good aaaannnddddddd there are a lot of smurfers on there too. I've been playing for like 1 or 2 now, can't remember when I did my account, but I'm still bronze. The thing is, you have to be a lot more map aware and a bit of a strategist of you want to play on this server. Cause the EU server, sorry, you guys play like a bunch of savages🤣🤣🤣and come what may LMAO!
You get the skin, it’s items, and the quests.

smurfing, as I understand it, is playing in an elo that is lower than your skill actually is and you shouldn't be in. If you are drunk your skill is silver, which is why you aren't ascendant already. Imagine you'd be playing drunk on your main. You'd have 0 kills and just int your team cause you cannot focus. Just play the game the way you feel best

Officially its not allowed.  
But riot just doesnt do anything. 

Basically everyone i play with has at least 2 accounts.   
If you smurf the people you play with wont judge you, but the internet will.

Don‘t smurf. Its not good for the game and the players.   
You dont want smurfs in your games? So dont be a smurf in other peoples games.  
Otherwise there is a good video from woohoojin on smurfing and why it hurts the community.
I never understood why people do this.
I honestly think they calculate it so you’re never in the position of 10 away. It’s frustrating

Pretty sure they had a glitch around that time frame that let people play STW for free before it got patched.  You probably played it during that short window.
I’m sure it gives you some sort of alert that he’s ulted in your area. You can prob ult cancel with omen to avoid. Has you can kj and the rest of the ults like that.
That raze sounds nearly just like me, and it tripped me the heck out. I had to rewatch the clip 4 times to check if it was an alt or smth. Actually tripped me up so hard.

You're putting to much pressure over a ranked match, the best way to conquer that fear is by playing the game. You can do it! Relax and enjoy the game
True but better aim won't make anyone rank up (except if we are veru low rank likr silver/gold and less

>It's not for you if it doesn't work.

It is working on OP.  Hes checking his store every time he logs on so he can buy certain skins.  

Eventually he may get them.  Then the next time a cool skin comes out he is gonna remember how long he had to wait last time, and jump on the opportunity to buy now.  

Its a long term strategy.  The more skins released, the more rare they become, and people may start buying more often just so they don't miss out later and regret it.
Now we can’t be as useful as entry :( might as well play brim atp
Your MMR does impact your placement after the reset. If you have high MMR for your end of episode rank then you will see little to no de-ranking. If you have low MMR you will see a much bigger de-rank. Your MMR was probably pretty good for your end of episode rank (unless you're a low rank already) because you only dropped two ranks. Mine wasn't as good, and despite playing well and going 3-2 in my placements I dropped from G3 to S1
p3 was my initial guess, not that far off! I been hardstuck  diamond for a long ass time too lol
Honestly any non duelist agent is a real gamble in solo queue, makes you appreciate the other ranks alot

I feel the same way lmao, im a jett main through and through as my mechanical aim is my strong suit but she feels boring, I wanna learn to play neon since the whole bhopping thing you see grumpy and other neon main youtubers pull off is quite fun but rn I just don't have the time to learn her so I enjoy playing with jett
what videos did you watch where it clicked that you have to pre aim corners, comm better with the team etc
if u ever want to try another role, and are a pretty argessive cypher, try out jett. the in-smoke action and aggressivity translates pretty well
1-2 minutes queues for most people, and you can do everything you want while in queue. what do u want to prove omg

Yeah she’s just very socially awkward.

I hope they can at least make a couple of new slots with all the skins they’re releasing. That or some system like in league where you can reroll 3+ items together and get a one random one. Been waiting for the reaver knife for over 3 months now and no luck. I have also noticed that for some reason I get the same skins over and over again (like RGX Vandal) makes me wonder how randomized the store is..

From the wiki which sources a Sage voice mail: The variety of radiant powers can be grouped under a spectrum; whilst many radiants are the source of their own powers, other can have complications or can only gain access to radiant powers through using some sort of object.


So Harbor and Gekko may not be recognized as full or natural Radians, but may be considered partial depending on perspective.

No it is more team coordination. I play a lot of Kayo, especially on ascent where I know a ton of lineups, but whenever I call a flash, teammates NEVER wait for it to pop. It is so annoying that sometimes I just keep my flashes for myself
What is this meant to do? I assume it’s when you place clones around corners to get used to aiming at their heads. 

Won’t the clones disappear after some time though?
well no that would stupid to do that since the gun budy you receive shows your PEAK for that act, if you peaked plat 2 in act 8 and received a plat gun budy with the gold,silver,bronze,.. buddies that also showed act 8(for example), people would think you maybe peaked bronze for that act, so you won't ever see progress

I don’t think it’s that bad to make his wall stop/stationary. Given that wall and cove give more cover it makes sense they have health. A smaller flat wall that can be walked thru and barely lasts a half defuse seems like a reasonable buff. 

In theory the wall can be used like this anyway if u send it towards the enemy. The length of time makes it so much harder to use already, compared to giving it health to break. I think you’re greatly over estimating his wall
If you don't trust anybody, just use Phoenix

They want to excel at what they're spending their valuable spare time on. As fast as they can. Just because you half-ass it doesn't mean you have to belittle others lol.

If they can spend the funds to buy a new monitor or mouse/keyboard without hurting their well-being, who cares? It's towards something they enjoy doing. 

I agree that they shouldn't rage at you for how you play. If you do something wrong, or don't clutch the round, friends shouldn't punish the other friend when they're clearly trying their best. Say "Nice Try", learn from your mistake and move on.

If you want to play just for fun, a competitive 5v5 game isn't it. Maybe try Helldivers or something?
Basically, for the ball smoke maps, I recommend Omen or Astra, sometimes Brimstone. The ball smoke maps in the game right now would be Ascent, Bind, Lotus, Split, and Sunset. The wall smoke maps are Breeze and Icebox. Dividing up the maps like this in your mind will make it easier to think about them.

Brimstone is good on Bind because it's small, and his ult gets people trapped in bad spots. I would say he's not good on Sunset or Lotus because they're just a bit too wide. The other two maps, he's okay. In general, I would recommend Astra or Omen depending on who you're feeling or what your team comp would work better with.

For the wall smoke maps, I recommend Viper usually, but I think Harbor is awesome, underrated, and people should play him more.

As for guides, I highly recommend Flowshizzle for Astra. I'm not sure if he has any new content as of recent, but he has in-depth guides for a couple of maps. A good Omen guide would just teach you how to flash for your team and maybe how to play aggressive. This is a short one here:  https://youtu.be/tqfLncnbQOs?si=jq-zOYlYjR8n2MRR


I would moreso recommend a guide on how to lurk and a guide on how to play controller in general. You would lurk more with Astra, Omen, and Viper. You would play more with your team with Brimstone and Harbor.

I would watch one in-depth guide for whichever character you prefer more (probably Omen or Astra) and apply those concepts everywhere. A lot of ideas transfer between them.

In general, as long as you choose a ball smoke character on a ball smoke map and a wall smoke character on a wall smoke map, don't worry about making the exact right choice. Go with what's comfy and be confident always.
not entirely true, i'm gold and it feels better to me.  but i could go back to 144 if i had to no problem, it's not a big game changer or anything.
whats wrong with the gaia axe, i like its kinda like prime axe
i’m iron 1 and i can consistently get ~26 bots on medium…
afaik theres no bots at the game at all, only in their other games like LoL
raze in beta

jett in the first year of the game

after playing dualist and the backseating nature of mumbai server I decided to never play dualist in comp games. 

I now fill in almost every game.
Everyone makes jokes about attack sage being goated but then you try to attack with the sentinel meant for being aggressive and site protection and now it’s a problem 🙄
I can see a case for 4 deaths

1) clove dies in the beginning of the round

2) sage revives instantly

3)if we are on fracture, sage collects all 4 orbs and then maybe gets 4kills+ plant or an 5 kills including a resurrected opponent/enemy sage

4) clove dies again

5) self revive and then dies again

Did i overcook or nah
Ah ok excellent, thank you!
Vouch
AMAZING 10/10
Welp time to grind didn't know ow there. Was. Ra ked in 11 days this game is sick I could see playing it lo term it feels so amazing and smooth I just need to get a bit better I see people shopping on ps5
what rank are you?
Ty that’s really helpful :)
Imagine SSD endurance in that zone
Roughly 1500cm.
Id love to see your tracker
[removed]
yes i can lol

Even with doing 1 consecutive amount off smashes and the regen time needed with both loadouts is enough to extrapolate the results!

I calculated the following results :

Fossil : 24 smashes in 60 seconds

Arc. Jess : 21 smashes in 60 seconds

&#x200B;

these results are calculated from following parameters :

Fossil : 4 amc in 5 seconds with 5 seconds regen time 

Arc. Jess : 6 amc in 8 seconds with 9 seconds regen time

&#x200B;

So I gathered this information out of a 10 second and a 14 second test sample!!!
They say it’s broken for content. The same way content creators said gekko was op on release, and then he saw no time in pro play and stopped getting played in comp (until gekko buffs) because he’s really not that good.
1. Shrouded Step still works the same way in the first link. There's a sound cue from where he teleports from and to, but the sound cue for his teleporting to/teleport destination is very small compared to when he initiates the ability.

2. They won't know where you are ulting from. But of course, the whole map will know if you ulted :\^)

3. They have to be within range to hear where you ulted to, and to hear if you cancelled or not. Some players might use the ult indicator on the player ui on the top of the screen to see if you cancelled or not though, by checking if the green square is active for a certain amount of time or not.
Im with you honestly, this community is so trash

Can you imagine like a 'battle the storm' mode where you had to push forward into it and defeat waves of husks that focused on YOU while you had to keep going to get to a bunker or somrthing
Mental stability, reflexes that aren't abnormally slow and a certain capability to learn...

If you lack one of those, you'll never make it.

If you lack time to practice or dedication to learn an agent properly, you won't get there either

I'm a plat, and sometimes during a bad day, I only kill less than 5. Thats totally fine. Just mute chat and voice on your team.

I regret buying it. Skins aren't particularly good. I don't even care enough to max it. I think I will do my weeklies.  And that's it. Whatever level I get to will have to do. 
It's what most people recommended to me, it's only for aim training. It's about an hour and a half.
Aimlab won't make you improve your crosshair placement and recoil control which is probably about 80% of the kills anyway. Keep on playing the game, remember they are the same rank as you for a reason.
You know that in buy phase you can just equip the smoke and immediately place it when the round starts?
As a boomer with monies, these games never made a massive difference in equipment. In general running these games at the lowest possible settings sometimes gives advantages too since the game runs smoother and doesn’t render in unnecessary stuff. You’ll just have to grind it out.
if you have a friend that plays, swallow your pride and ask them to teach you some basics in a private server. starting fresh without a buddy to guide you makes the learning process slower

google average valorant pro sensitivity and choose something close to that

use your arm to make large adjustments in aim and wrist for small ones

ive gotten several friends to try valorant and they all got shat on for the first several months, you should make peace with this fact and focus on improving one step at a time (or having fun)
I have codes available, I don’t own a ps5 or xbox so whichever consoles want it the most  I’ll just give them out
Pick your main. Work on your mechanics. Learn how to take fights. Forget about strategy until you hit plat just go after the weakest player. That's basically it and never fill fuck that shit you ain't a loser.

Anyone with the ability to think critically could've seen these buffs being bad.

Movement duelists have overshadowed much of the cast for most of the games lfiespan and have been problem characters nerfing the others over the years and then turbocharging the mobility part of neon over anything else is just tone deaf of what is strong in the game.
Splitting A will go crazy for sure
My point wasn’t to say an agent isn’t viable at immortal. But that’s when I think team comps become important because coordination among players gets more consistent.
Hey guys I have an issue with my Valorant voice chat and in-game audio   
I have a one-plus Bluetooth neckband   
when the input and output device is set to default system device the mic quality is good but the in-game audio sucks and when I shift the input device to my laptop mic then the  in-game audio is good but the mic quality is bad   
is there any solution  so that both in-game and mic quality are good or do I have to buy a new mic

THATS THE POINT OF THE 2.0 BUNDLES???
Also if you need someone to play stw and explain i don't mind helping out since I play stw daily😊
Honestly, i woulda done the same thing. I want to punish toxic players so much just to show how much impact i have on the team on those rounds. Trolls and toxic players deserves to be shamed and trolled.
We need strafing bots back [this](https://medal.tv/games/valorant/clips/1z5xEdD3oiZ32R/spok?invite=cr-MSw0ZkwsMjAwODcwNjg4LA
) is not strafing
Spiderman confirmed
its annoying but its not like its broken, if you cant counter 4 odins its a skill issue
I'd suggest you to start your journey from swiftplay cuz it's a more casual mode with only 15 minutes matches while it provides the same in-round experience. In the same timespan you will play 2-3 times more matches on different maps with different people and if you have a bad experience in some match, it doesn't matter cuz this match will end very soon and you'll hop on the next one. It's the least stressful way to learn the game ngl.
Ascendant was top 8% players. Now its top 3%.

Being stuck in the shrunken low diamond/high plat if you barely were able to touch the bloated ascendant last act. I was an A1 end last act, this act has been much harder, though I did eventually make it back.

I was fighting washed up immortals all the way to a1. Immortal was also bloated and is now a bit more reasonable.

I'm really curious to know why do you think Fade is good on Ascent and Split.
I main both Sova and Fade and I can agree that she's sick on Sunset, but I think Sova is much better on Ascent, if you have lineups. 
With lineups you can clear util, scan and wallbang, go for double shockdart on default plants/postplants/most common op angles. You can literally play the game without directly seeing enemies most of the time.

I really like fade on Pearl. She has sooo many insane scans for basically any part of the map. They are mostly support scans as you can't peak off of yourself, but with comms it's pretty deadly, especially on B. And as a bonus, you can hold mid and get a lot of info with dogs.
Lotus is the same, a lot of good eye spots for smoke spamming, dogs are really valuable for taking territory in almost any situation.

Fade on Split is good and can get a lot of info, but I feel like the map is too closed for any type of scan agents. It's too easy to hide from it and it may even be dangerous if your team relies on it too much. Dogs are also less valuable due to elevation, sieze is okay. I feel like Kayo is the best scan agent on Split.
This is why I play solo/with friends only nowadays. Big oof.
In short, he’s wrong, and that’s why he’s silver. 

Break it down to him like this. With the numbers below representing firearm strength by player and then added below. The difference in strength, not taking into account personal skill, being a representation of your teams likeliness to win the round. 

Pistol rd.:
Team A 1-1-1-1-1 vs Team B 1-1-1-1-1 
5 - 5 (even playing field) 

Rd. 2: 
Team A 1-1-1-1-1 vs Team B 3-4-3-3-3
5 - 16 (3.2x more likely to win) 

Rd. 3 (Bonus eco) 
Team A 4-4-4-4-4 vs Team B 3-4-1-1-1 
20 - 14 (1.42x more likely to lose) 

So would you rather play;
even-advantage-slight disadvantage 
for the first 3 rounds or;
even-even-even. 

The answers obvious. 

Also, don’t buy full shields on their buy rounds, only on their eco. 

Vandal:

40 dmg x 3 body = 120 (alive with half shield) 
40 dmg x 4 body = 160 (dead either way) 
160 dmg to the head kills you either way too

Pros do it for a reason, now you know. 

Thank you for listening to my TedTalk.
Thanks for the feedback!
thats usually my approach to things, except ive barely ever had to mute anyone

for context, my peak was dia3 but im currently in plat1 after a 9 month break, and i tend to IGL in every game because people tend to not know what to do. no one ever argues when i make calls like stacking a site on or pushing mid eco, playing slow or making team plays with util. idk if its just an EU servers thing but people dont complain nearly as much as you'd expect
I hear you, but I reported someone who was really toxic on mic & chat(really awful stuff) and Epic responded to me about a month later, saying they had taken suitable action with that account!  I was so surprised and glad and so I wld still report people…

I think having the two TP anchors is nice for putting them in spots that the current single TP anchor won't let you do. 

For example, Ascent A site, the tall box on heaven. I would like to stand up there and TP to hell. But you currently cannot put the single anchor back under hell while on top of the box. Though the TP still fine as it is. 

The real buff Chamber needs is global range on the trip. That is definitely the most limiting factor on Chamber right now. You trip the flank in the most optimal position and the range can't even reach onto either site for almost all maps.
Dude? I’ve had to entry bc my duelist dont 💀 bozo
Cringe community (imo), smurfing, pretty bad at coaching

Took my 5 games of ranked to reach diamond
This is correct. Thanks for clarifying for me! I didn’t phrase it very well.
This is the fix I was looking for!!! Thank you so much!!!! They spawn here on power lvl 108 and above for me on ps5.
Also, I said these three but mentioned four characters. My phone is acting funny, and it was difficult to change previous text.
Falls for it immediately
As an instalock gekko on some maps, I'm hurt by your statement. JK but I usually lock him on lotus, sometimes fracture just depending on what comp looks like. I feel like as an initiator main I can play gekko well on lotus, based on the cover and different sight lines as well as cramped spaces. 

My red flags in agent select are people who are on the mic too much, especially if they are making jokes that seem like "im up at 2 am playing comp" jokes. In my experience these people end up flaming you for weird stuff, act like they can't make a mistake, constantly deflect blame and responsibility, and just make you feel bad after one mishap. This happened to me last night actually, where I whiffed on a Jett because they updrafted, dashed, and updrafted again by the ledge with plants on it on split A site while I was trying to clutch. Unfortunately, I ran out of mouse pad space since I play low sens and one of my team mates flamed me for the rest of the game. The enemy Reyna started flaming me telling me to quit the game and said "you're the reason it's 12-12 rn." My teammates were also ganging up on me in all chat so I just hit em with the "riot thinks you're as bad as me" and continued playing. 

I definitely played badly, but I had impact. Always gave effective comms, such as what is open, what I hear, what I don't hear, stuff like that. I have experience in CVAL so I would say I know how to comm, but I got flamed for watching mid when both players were B main. It was commed that both players were there, but there were 45 seconds on the clock, no sound had been made in 10 seconds, and the bomb was picked up by the enemy. We had two players watching B main, and I was jump spotting market from mail for info. When I explained myself in game, my team just said "we commed that they were B main, look at the map." 

I'm not the greatest player, but rank reset has me back in plat, so I said "plat players think they're all that" and I ended up with no response from either team. 

Sorry for the rant, but this has happened enough times that people who talk a little too much are a red flag in agent select.
Where did you get insecure from? Your entire account has you dealing with some pretty shitty insecurities yourself lmao sounds like your just projecting
NO FUCKING WAYYY #PINOYPRIDE
Thanks friend!
You can get immortal 3 with really good mechanics and just a below average brain, but an no brain would put you in low immortal prob
Well yes but a wall hack isn't viewing a publicly posted piece of content and using that to your advantage. If a sports team posted their playbook online for the world to see ..why would other teams be bad if they used that as an advantage? If something is public then it's public. It may be unsportsmanlike but that's it.
I understand and completely agree. That doesn't change the fact that people who belonged in immortal last act, whose skill has not changed, are not in immortal due to the distribution changing, and this cascades down the ranked ladder. The ironically unfortunate people that maintained their ranks in diamond, but whose skill level also has not changed, have been having a significantly harder time after this ranked reset than prior ones. A lot of people have also had a harder time climbing back to their ranks for a similar reason, and doubly so given how much harsher the rank reset was. Some people got kicked way further down than they generally were, meaning the skill disparity in each match was way more rocky than it is even after past rank reset. I chose to mostly avoid this act for that very reason. Every win is a huge rr boost because my MMR is still high, but every match feels like a complete team-diff win or lose, which isn't normally how the end of an act feels. The end of this act feels like the start of a normal rank reset lol
I think if you record them and have enough proof, you can escalate it to Riot to get them banned faster.
Some of my affliction tidbits:

Dragon's Roar assault rifle has "innate" affliction that stacks if you also have affliction as the 6th perk.

Arleen Izza heals for each affliction tick if using a melee weapon with affliction as the 6th perk.

Hybrid's adds fire affliction to dragon slash even if he's only in support. Hybrid is useful for a zenith build as he adds 2 affliction ticks when used in support.
Hey did anyone figure this out??
I play csgo but I second this
In plat i got the most toxic players 😂
Diamond is not the same as immo 3 bro. You are only 400 ranks away from diamond 1. Immortal is 1000 rr away. Not comparable. The diamonds could also have been queuing with the gold, further lowering the mmr of their party
Oh god not again
i swear the creative maps nowadays are basically roblox games
I just think it has too many hiding holes and angles that need to be cleared for a map thag is as big as it is. Rotating on it takes forever while also being unfairly dangerous for defenders IMO.

I won't be dodging it, but it's fair to not like the map, regardless of how new it is.
Oh I had no idea I just remembered linking my xbox account for the bonuses is why I mentioned it
Easy, play Chamber. 
He has the same get away ability as his TP. You also don't need to go in first and you can fully focus on your mechanics and aim since he has no other team support utility.
does that mean that if a 5hp armor carries over then it goes to 150 during the ult?
Thanks. Not sure why I'm downvoted for a question legit question.
No founder account 🤷 2019
For me it is probably Araxys. I use the shit out of the entire bundle aside from the melee.

It was hard to choose tbh, I like the Kuronami, Imperium, and overdrive bundles a lot too. But there are so many honorable mentions in the premium skin tier. Chronovoid, Glitchpop, Singularity to name a few. I haven't really been able to choose recently, I have had skin shuffle on with SIlver Araxy, White/Pink Overdrive, and White Kuronami. I had the vandal from the BP on the shuffle but got tired of only getting that 90% of the time.

Personally though, I hate the Prelude and I don't see what others see in it. It looks weird in hand, extremely distracting, plus I hate the kill sounds. Why do so many people think that skin is goated?
What do you mean if you are a founder? New STW buyers don't get daily quests for v bucks or the rare v buck missions?
Imagine not caring what "others" think - and one making their own mind up... 
Let him play what he wants he’s trying to learn a new agent, which shouldn’t matter unless he’s doing it in the higher elos at that point he’s griefing  you which is valid.
Damn, that hurt 🫠 Jk

How
i did it to diamond
That's not because of her kit. That's because those people are the pocket sages getting carried by smurfs. Look at the average kd and the average winrate with a duo of those players.
would love one as well. could you send through dms?
I didn't get a feel for the game until level 25 (I'm like 32 rn) but I get what you're saying.  If you play consistently enough you'll probably do alright within 2-3 days depending on how much experience you have in general
To be fair, iso and Jett are also Asian. And Neon 😅

which should i prioritize getting? accessory, agents, agent contracts? i only play Reyna so should i go for the accessories since they are limited time only, then the agent contracts, then get the agents?
I didn't want people to catch me being a girl, playing sage AND BAD / NEW to valorant / fps so I bit the bullet and mained sova in my first few games 💀

now I let my inner sage go wild, I love her slow orbs with every cell of my body 😎
Some people are better at adapting than others. For example, I peaked ascendant 2 on my 60 Hz monitor, and I was still consistently climbing. However, a better example is my friend who is currently Immortal 2 who plays on a laptop with a max fps of 30. Of course better hardware will yield better results, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t push through the challenge.
Take mid control, cut off b and stop being a pussy.
Save the World fans when they want the game they paid for to have its bugs fixed instead of being strongarmed into playing by a lazy developer
Bro I migrated to valorant from leauge and let me tell you it's better to just not have coms the toxicity in the type chat is bad enough but if coms were in leauge the only thing that will keep the game alive after that is the pro scene
OP tell us please
Yes
If im doing play with others people who are doing deliver the bomb 4 atlas missions alone get an instant exit out of the lobby from me. If I join a 160 and nobody is near the objective that's an instant leave to me. People like me have leveled up. We don't care about missions failing or leaving.
Wait do u mean there’s bots that collect these daily rewards 4 u? Or what?
You do know reddit doesnt have a limit to the amount of text you can send in one msg right? 

But fine, send me a vod of one of your ranked games and if i see it and i think “oh this person would deserve diamond if he played more” i will back off and admit it. I cant make any assumption for you specifically but in general, people who say they can reach a higher rank without any proof dont actually deserve the rank. I know the difference between a plat and diamond player, ive spent most of my time of playing valo in those two ranks. You can send an unlisted yt vid through reddit dms or msg me there and ill send you my discord info. And dont send me a win, send me a loss where u felt like it was because of your teammates. Or the first game you play that day
Reminds me of a game my mom used to play called "no hug for you".

Careful. If you follow that survivor outside, they'll run back in and lock the door behind you.
They got you though. Their business plan worked. That's $222.70 dollars they wouldn't have made with a less scummy monetization scheme.
Killjoy, Skye and Harbour for me
You can't say that you can aim if you've been bronze for 2 *episodes*

This game isn't difficult enough when it comes to macro or theory that it could hold back someone who's able to consistently out aim opponents and in bronze that bar is set very low
Valorant is a game where team comp depends on the map. So to give one team the first pick on the best agent on the map is already an advantage. Imagine it’s breeze and only one team gets to have viper and sova. In Riots other game,League of legends, because it’s one map and draft picks are so champions can try to countered other champions. Instead of causing value on other agents, it would highlight how weak certain agents are on maps compared to others. Lastly you can’t do a role lock like in LoL or Overwatch due to the same map problem. Which map should have double on which role. There are too many factors to limit to draft or role lock.
Mfkers will call anything bi or gay nowadays

W8 wut?? I cover B AND mid simultaneously on Breeze with Viper. Daphuq?
Solution: play smokes anyway
I think leaf is 0.16-0.18 and demon1 if you convert it to 800 dpi it’s around 0.2
So just don’t pick her?
Allmost killed ya, oops 🤣🤣🤣
isnt that what the characters actually say tho?
My aim isn’t that good yes, but it’s enough for the lobbies I play in right now. Of course cypher isn’t impenetrable wall but when there’s a 50/50 chance on which site the enemy will attack or do a split, it’s better to either equally distribute sites or have less on cypher’s site. 

I setup my one ways before the start of the round and mark them and communicate to the controller, not to smoke there. Like split B main I’ll tell an omen to not smoke B main and just as the enemy feet are spotted on my cam I trigger the cage to kill them and right there omen would smoke there and block my vision of there feet.

I’m not saying I want to solo a site, it doesn’t work (most of the time) but at least someone should watch mid and the other site.
Well wildlife is a relatively new feature tbh, there is no main quests that need wildlife but the Gia quest line (On right now under : “brawl of the wild”) need them for quests.  

But wildlife in general are kinda useless tbh. Although epic are doing some tinkering with them, some in todays update so we’ll see if they ever become useful
[deleted]
Cyan Gaia's Vandal and as for melee, definitely Revear knife.
One good tip would be to put your crosshair on your teammate's head and not move it vertically after that.
Panic was also a thing I had, mainly because I was usually waiting for the enemy to peek and then fighting them.
Instead of waiting for them, play an agent with a flash like Omen or phoenix. Phoenix or some other duelist with flash is preferable. If you're phoenix, do a reverse flash where you flash behind you, if they're coming through long corridors and then get a kill and fall back to reposition in a different area to do another flash.
Passive plays generally make people anxious when they're initially starting out in Valorant. 
You could try learning the defense shock dart lineups which are pretty useful on sova to prevent plants or do some tick damage on planters.
Just stay in the game, with two afks and bots as teammates, you guys are going to be losing fast. Leaving a game is always gonna penalize you, just like it penalized the 2 afks on the team.
on an extra note . when normal people touch the cube or  interact with it they get corrupted by it. the cubes take over their body until they are essentially turned into a human cube hybrid. this is unfortnuately the case for cube assasin and geometrik. it is also the case for a new skin leaked in a survey who was an explorer that found a piece of the golden cube. she gets corrupted by it in a built in emote and one of her edit styles but unlike geometrik and cube assassin she  has the ability to turn back into a human being with the same built in emote, which btw is her spinning the tiny floating golden cube in her hand. shes definitely going to be a skin, because I believe survey skins are actually already fully made because when they come out later they look exactly like the 2d-3d ish survey model they gave us in the survey with no changes. And the exact same features. So I'm excited to see why shell be coming to the shop or battlepass or fortntie crew and what role shell be playing in the storyline. Maybe she'll be a honorary member of the last reality, not being born an alien but being a special enough human for the tiny golden cube she discovered to not turn her into a mindless cube hybrid like cube assassin and geometrik. Poor them

another thing is the last reality basically has a plan to colonize the entire universe and all realities. this is why the army is made up of so many different alien species, sentient robot species, etc. they even put emphasis on this based on the fact that you can customize Kymera to be so many different species with so many different features. the aliens and sentient robots in their army probably also lived on their own planet too until the last reality conquered the planet and they had to join the army this is why the army is so ‘diverse’. they wanted to colonize the Fortnite planet as well and this is why they started to terraform different POIs in C2S7., even changing the gravity to suit theirs, but the Fortnite people won and the island was saved and the mothership was taken down. well unfortunately the mothership broke and all the cubes it was holding landed on the ground and made the terraforming process even faster and even made the cube queen decide to visit the island herself but once again  the Fortnite people won and the entire island flipped to reveal the 7 hiding place.
Thanks!
Oh my god, what is it with this sub and blaming team comps for why a match goes bad. Team comps don't matter in low ranks, and there is no way that every single person in here is immo+. Let me break it down for you: in a ranked game you wanna do everything in your power to get advantages. How do you do that? Simple, you play your best agent. And surprise, surprise, but people tend to perform a lot better on an agent they main, cause they feel more confortable, they know how to use the util, they know the timings and how to play efficiently. On the other hand, people who fill a role tend to not know how the agent works, or little tips and tricks for that agent (look at Subroza, who in a ranked match filled as Omen on Ascent and failed the one way on A main, cause he didn't know how the collision on the white ball in the center of the Omen smokes worked). So filling in low ranks is useless because gunplay matters more, and filling in asc-immo 1 (ranks where team comp starts to get important) is bad cause you can't contribute effectively to your team due to lack of knowledge
As cringe as it might sound, TikTok is decent to find lineups.
Can i have one
Average redditor actually uses "/s" for sarcasm. You must be new to reddit.
Then you didn't give yourself long enough to adapt, or you were still on a super high sens. Once you get used to it, they are 10x better than a g502.
Yo I'm in the same boat. Was hardstuck silver for almost a year n now shot up to straight plat 1. Got my ass carried obviously. XD
For Me It’s Everytime I Say Something They Call Out The Fact That Im Black . Which Fucking Sucks So I Just Throw After That . It’s Really Making Me Not Like The Game Anymore
Good luck to him ☺️
I think you have it backwards.  Your hidden MMR is likely higher than your friends'.

You lose more RR than them because the matchmaker is expecting you (being higher MMR) to do better/win.  If your MMR is higher than the lobby average and you lose, you will lose more MMR than if you were at the same level as the lobby.
Well hes right so…

Chasing Good Vibes by Universal Production Music, it's on Spotify.
Without having a replay or watching the game, it's hard to say. Do they have profiles in websites like tracker.gg? Seeing their past stats and game history can be a good indicator if it's hacking or not.

Just from what you've said, I personally would say it's probable that they're cheating. 90% HS is crazy high, even for a smurf.
Nothing wrong with your suggestions but the issue is that he hasn't actually followed the guide. He may have loosely followed it, but he really just hasn't done it. The guide asks you to play 1 agents, but in Ep 7 Act 1 alone he has played 13 agents. The guide also has deathmatch in the warmup, but he has played only 2 games of deathmatch this entire act. He has played a few hours of TDM but the entire point of deathmatch is no util and constant fights. He may well be hardstuck or the guide won't work for him... but he hasn't actually followed it yet.
it’s better to do it before playing as it helps ingame. it can be done anytime if u feel like it
It says you're not accepting friend requests
That is what bunny hopping is. Jumping at a specific time to build momentum. Which isn't a thing in valorant. Just because you can spam jump doesnt make it a bhop.
Tap some heads on practice, run a Hard bots, then play 1 dm. Takes roughly 10 mins total, im dia
Id you’re playing casually it’s fine, but the higher up you get rank wise the more valuable info of any kind is. Missing say a Reyna throwing a blind on the other side of the for example
Depends on what the kid wants. The 20$ gift card gives about 2800. Which should be enough for him to get a thing or two. There’s also some skin packs for money(5-20 something dollars) that you could consider but since you don’t know what he likes then I wouldn’t recommend it
I hope one day it comes to console :(
lol because i have a friend who has a console and she wanted to play the game for a while, hope it’s for new accounts too
Started this end of january and played on and off silver 3 mainly because i play w friends and we troll and have fun more than sweating our asses off
Where did you buy the code from bro?
Got it. Thank you!
Silly statement. For some people gaming is their hobby. If they spend $1.5k and play for 1500 hrs over the course of 4 years that's $1/hr for enjoyment.

Not exactly mental can be when you lose 4 rounds in a row and they comeback might not always be toxicity
the average person should give you a pre-round’s worth of shit for “ace stealing.” I usually see (and honestly, participate) in a little “what the fuck, man, that was his ace!” ribbing, but by the time the next round starts I’ve already forgotten about it. 

Any more than that is excessive. An ace is a lucky series of events in the average game. Better luck next time for them, and you made the right call in protecting the round win rather than a clip. I have seen many, many games where someone feeds the enemy in hopes for an ace and the round turns into a loss because of it.

I need one still 🥲
There aren't any rescue the survivor missions in this power range...
That was funny af tho
[removed]
I am getting killed by bots 😢
idt thats how it works, from what I know if you dropped more than 1 rank it means ur mmr is either at the rank u were before or below that. Nothing to do with timing to do placements.
I usually don't do my placements immediately but i went from dia 1 to plat 1 a few acts ago doing placements almost immediately and losing i think 4/5 games
Skill issue to tbh. Just hide behind something or build. First time seeing someone complain about that useless gun...

No you just don't play the game right like most of the community i have 2500 hours but whatever I knew how to play the game right after a month
I mean, it makes sense in a way
The uh commander have you turned into a husk got me
Yeah not many at all.
You sure it's not 800/0.07?

Cuz 560 eDPI is plenty good to not feel like you can't move, even if you're used to 1600 eDPI. 

But 250 eDPI would certainly feel that way in the beginning.  Heck, even after you get used to it, it's not that maneuverable unless you're swiping away on a footlong mouse pad. But that's why they use it, cuz your aim won't shake easily.

Valorant has raw input so this has no affect on your sens.
I honestly said we as a general term, personally i do not like him to much
What complaints are there about DM? lol

Go try and play COD or something, then you'll see a company who really doesn't care about their product. Riot are doing just fine
I think it's alright idea for your controller or someone who isn't an entry to buy/stay on sheriff round 2 and then pick the gun off the dead Reyna. Especially if they wanna OP R3.

Playing with other people is considered cheating these days? Oof
care to give context?

Around 600 hrs valorant
Super washed d2 peak ascendant 1
I think they are trying to put more emphasis on mid. The map was supposed to be called pit and revolve around a pit in mid, but they changed that because it didn't work. But you can still see in the map layout that this map was supposed to have interesting fights in mid. It kinda worked out, but 5 man A and B main is still the best tactic. They also said that Pearl encourages teamplay, strategies and ability interactions. I think they want to push the map even more in this direction. Opening up mid a bit more and make A and B main less safe options.
I can’t answer this. On the side of the game tho it’s is a very dry map that needs a re work.
People would win medals for the gymnastics they do to justify their bigotry ngl - it always makes them sound absolutely deranged
No Arcane sherif so 1$

Good shit dude
Over 10,000
It’s not
Is this really a girl thing or just a valorant thing? Im a guy and I have a deep voice so I’m assuming that’s the reason but I constantly have teammates saying they want to fuck me or be fucked by me. I don’t think the sexual jokes are just because you’re a girl. I think it’s just that this is a toxic place overall.
When will Epic bring back the old V-BUCKS system?
how big is it see bot?
Thanks
[removed]
Nah I've hit ascendant back 2 episodes back to back. Each act. If you belong to the rank, you can reach back no problem. The problem to me was, how the fuck these boosted up here.
About to finish 🗿
73% not my proudest moment.
I once thought of an ability that doesn’t let you swap nor reload guns as a “twin” to kayos suppressing
Or if one person in the gunfight isn’t on ethernet… the amount of times I’ve seen the blood come out of someone’s head and heard the bullet land but it registered as through a wall/floor.
Honestly why don’t you just plant then throw the wall on it😂, no need for lineups. It takes like 20 bullets to destroy anyways so with the new mag size doubt anyone at post plant has that much ammo anyways
Your right.... they will be removed on next update

At one point you won't be able to compensate for the lack of aim anymore. You need to be smart and confident in your mechanics, it's an fps game. Play "smart" to avoid fights is generally a bad mindset.
I'm sure I've paid dearly multiple times to fish stuff out of the collection book that I'd previously shredded.

I love when people instalock Omen or Viper
Thank you for a well balanced opinion and for being polite. Most of here call me out as insane, toxic player, iron player and other stuff haha

Either way yeah, I'm not even engaging with any of these people in this thread, almost all of them are very radical about Valorant and can seems to gaps the ideia of feedback or why it's important for the player base and devs.
If someone is toxic to a female in my games for no other reason than she's a female, I just flame them back, because it's free entertainment.

Now I've run into a few toxic females as well, it's just online gaming really, mute, report and enjoy the game. 

Lots of times this is a easy L but it's just make believe internet points anyway who cares?
If you want rank up fast, first master one agent/role that you’re good at and start grinding.

I am not even 100 lvl so it wont be a problem for me I guess they'll add it before I reach that level
It looks like one of those bucket mousetrap compilations
Thank you
100% possible if you intentionally jump down 3 times without anything that’s forcing you to do it
Actually it's the other way around. The system tries to get you faster in the direction of your hidden mmr. If you win more RR than you lose then the system thinks you should be ranked higher.
If you lose more than you win than you should be ranked lower.

Sometimes it's hard to break through that, but the only way is to keep playing and keep winning.
If you’re a working adult playing this game, chances are you already do plenty of small talk in the office. Once I reach home I just wanna kick back, relax and enjoy some gaming.
Not sure.
But i just dont add randoms uk it feels wierd cuz all of them r toxic .. atleast most of them if not all.

I have 5 6 frnds who play valo i duo trio or 5 man with them only ..
Thats a good point actually
I guess peoples idea of fun is different, boring as hell imo lol
cascade one direction to block off an enemy LOS to peek another, sorta like a jet smoke. cascade towards and through the enemy to create pressure and an advantageous gunfight for you and your teammates. they don't know when or if you're going to stop it so you can use that to your advantage. if you don't fw him that's ok but just bc you don't know how to use his abilities doesn't mean they're bad
Ahh then I have to start comp and prove everyone wrong
I mean you can still go in to train and get annoyed you spawned into someones lap 4 times in a row. I don't mind dying i mind dying like 8 times before I run it back lmfao
No thats because im not looking to play with children such as you
Blud has no idea what initiators are
i never said it was good i said i had a basic understanding 💀

BIG CANNON
reyna next trust bro
Yup so probably thats bad 💀😂
Plat has less Smurf’s and it’s more consistent to climb in than gold right now. I’m not a great player, I climbed to diamond on my main playing sentinel and playing smart and I have another account that gold 1 that I just mess around with and my gold games are harder than my high play games. So many Smurfs right now in gold that are boosting their friends and dropping 35+ kills. Ranked sucks so bad right now. The mmr is not working because you have peak gold , plat playing against peak acs last act and they get stomped. Idk how tf that’s intended.
My uncle is a 41 year old peaked immo1. 

I’m 24 been queuing with him for about 12 years now. I haven’t really noticed a fall off. When he still played val he locked Jett and Reyna and just ego peeked and won gunfights. 

I think he could’ve climbed more. He didn’t really care to actually learn the game and went back to cs though.
150 with overhealth + 50 shield from Iso's ult maybe?
Are you winning most of your duels? If you are but everyone else has way more kills, you are probably playing too passively. If you aren't winning most of the time, you aren't as good at aim/movement/etc. as you think.
Jett. Korean.
Yeah my voice isn’t feminine but it isn’t exactly super deep either so I still have to deal with this crap, much support to the girls who play VAL
maybe just keep it light today, a banana and some yogurt
You’re overthinking aiming. No one uses arm for micro adjustments, and this game is about 90% micro adjustments. You use your arm for sweeping motions, wrist for finer adjustments. If you’re holding an offangle and have good crosshair placement, are you really going to use your arm to flick a tiny amount to adjust? How about peaking normal angles?
he just asking

(Faceit 7 is quite above average, it just feels average because of how many people have played CS, so even "top 5% peak" is still millions of people.)

IMO just 2k elo on Faceit is already comparable to low immortal 3 in Valorant, for time and effort to get there with no prior experience in either game. Even 4 years after this game's release, plenty of peak Imm3 have less than 2000 hours on valorant with no/little prior cs playtime.

You'll probably place gold and then quickly climb to mid-plat or low-diamond, at which point you might hit a bit of a wall in terms of valorant-specifc map & character knowledge.

I'd honestly recommend playing someone other than KAY/O even if he feels comfortable. His kit isn't as good as others in ladder, because he was nerfed due to his pickrate in pro play. [He's had the lowest winrate of all characters for over a year.](https://tracker.gg/valorant/insights/agents?division=immortal)
I have the same exact problem, happens every time within minutes of launching Valo, my sound card is ASUS Xonar DX
yeah
Lmao what? If an orange can taste like an orange. So should an apple.
Be aware, traps also count towards the built limit.

However, traps can still be placed afterwards to go over the limit. That's why it's advised to build everything first *then* add traps.

Unfortunately, doing things that way means you'll have to destroy a lot more to get back under the build limit, as you'll end up with a number like 1450/1000 builds.
Every point you made here is correct. But you forgot one tiny thing. People in low rank NEED something to blame for them being hardstuck, and they have collectively decided that smurfing is the reason. 

Even though any player who has achieved even mid ranks will tell you that it’s nearly impossible to stay in low ranks once you are legitimately past that skill level. But the majority of this sub has no hopes of ever being high rank, because they will continue to make excuses and blame external factors. So, in their impotence, all they can do is rage and downvote. 

And it doesn’t help that certain content creators who specifically make content targeted at new players paint all smurfing as evil. This is done knowingly to stroke the ego of the new players, give them a scapegoat and turn them into loyal cultists, parrotting every word. 

It’s best to avoid this sub, especially as a high rank player.  There is basically nothing of value on it. I don’t know how you’d fix it without burning it down and starting over. 

And you went a lot harder against smurfing here than i would have personally, but the fact of the matter is, nobody is allowed to publicly enjoy any kind of smurfing here. The good news is that reddit isn’t a real place. 

The people complaining about competitive integrity are the same people who don’t fill smokes, refuse to learn proper comms, have zero macro game sense, don’t look at minimap, “don’t have time” to warm up, bait team mates every round, and make noise when your team is being quiet. They don’t care about competitive integrity, they care that they have SOMETHING that they can feel superior about, if only morally. 

Your videos and other “smurfing” has helped a lot of people. Keep it up. You’re not allowed to be here, and neither are people who appreciate what you do, so it will seem like a vacuum of hate, since reasonable voices are silenced by the masses. 

Ignore Reddit, have fun, get paid.
You are talking about rr tho?

I don't know how MMR works but you literally just explained RR system.

Lmao 😂,the viper player is definitely banging their table or keyboard after what happened
I’m actually so weirded out how I’ve gotten games where I’ve gone against 2 duos or one 3-stack and then my team has no one else queued up together.
The rgb butterfly knife or the fan knives
Yes as long as the provoke isn't over a certain threshold. Trash talk is also fine within the team.
IMO the sheriff and marshall are the only good guns from the neo frontier bundle
I thought its in the average range and a good deal since i also dont plan to buy anymore so.
I switched from cs to val a while back and at the very start Kay/o felt the most comfortable, the hit reg is way more forgiving in val so you’ll feel like a god the first couple weeks
i see it as more of an investment as i also have around $1k into it across 3 years but i have the arcane bundle and the first champions set. i feel like i can sell this account if i ever stop playing for a decent amount.
Well, to give a character a leverage, definitely could hurt the feelings of the *enemy* team.

Yet that same *enemy* team is pleased with the leverage when it's on their side!

I guess to focus on what the enemy team can do! Is the weirdest method of handling chatacter abilities!!! (This, I think, probably is how people who do not play with a group of friends think, cuz they are most of the time practically on their own) Try to think more of what your team can do!!!

Maybe their target isn't people who already play 12h/day
Of course he isnt slow compared to an avg play but compared to radiant ranked demons
Yes, yes and yes :D
They cohldnt have been born in 1880, there was no radiant crisis in 1880 :/ it makes perfect sense as is
If you’re going to talk about meta in competitive, you should state what elo you play in otherwise it’s pretty uninformative

There will be different metas in different levels of play
Deathmatch much better use of time imo
Fractures good you just have to aggressively take space on ct side
I am just hearing about the character buffs. You're saying that with Crossbones Barrett, you can only carry 8 coconuts at a time now???


If so, that is total garbage and I will probably recycle him to get my superchargers back. 
Nah man, this is why people have different tastes, I love the singularity knife, one of my favorites
Hard disagree with controllers planting other than harbor. Controllers have extremely impactful util late round, so keeping them out of site or at least out of danger should be a major priority. Harbor’s cove can make him an exception
Do you play really low PL missions? I play this game every day and don't remember the last time someone wanted to trade
Alright that makes sense, thank you. I'll keep an eye on it
There’s a cat 2 in the 108s rn
Screen?
these skins are literally the recycled versions of previous bp skins. Not to say they look bad, but they are definitely not given more than one thought in the development process
Yeah actually after 3 people leave the game should just automatically get cancelled let the winning team get like 10RR and no change to the loosing team
Being different doesn't excuse the fact that it gains more value exponentially as higher skill levels take advantage of his \*free\* ability. It might not be a problem in Diamond or Ascendant, where players body shot like no tomorrow, but when you have Radiants and pros complaining about it, players that understand the game immensely, use utility correctly, have developed top-tier aim, and know how to coordinate plays, that's when it becomes a problem. You would not be able to run it down like Demon1 and get 5Ks left and right with a Phoenix ult, an ability that requires 6 orbs to use. But you can do that with Iso's \*free\* ability and not take a hit of damage.
No she really is bad in high rank. In pro play she’s just AWFUL, but even in just high rank her kit really underperforms for entry in comparison to other duelist options. She’s just a really selfish character that doesn’t bring much to the team. You have to be REALLY good at getting kills with her in high ranks to perform well
I don't know but every unrated game i've had someone followed me for my skins & follow me while running. Its annoying.

I was trying to dodge a flash and the quick hand movement caused me to accidentally press mouse 1 and one tap an innocent Brimstone trying to follow his team onto the site.

Exactly, and that are things nobody made me aware of. Ranked with friends and competing there is way more fun once you’ve experience the comp scene 😅
It’s been happening since the original skin came out
Despite what a lot of people say, playing duelists (bar Reyna) is one of the best ways to improve as it basically forces you to improve all of the necessary mechanics by putting you in the more situations where you are playing decisively and not just reacting to what happens.
If you are in the game now, go into save the world. If you are able to join it then check your daily missions.
Bro he’s on console 😭
Looks like Mae’s pickaxe from the CH4S4 battle pass
Which servers u play on i met a neon multiple times with similar name
Raze then. Throw bombs. The jump packs stuff is hard to learn and get right.
Ok duelist instalock it is
what agents other than omen/yoru can fake the tp?
well legit it is, but is it shit? yes unfortunately, i hate it too, but people dont care. Valve decided to have a different policy with anticheat and pays the price. RIOT cares about cash only with the skins and no new content for Val, and CS has shit anticheat that doesnt work, neither are perfect
Yeah, sure.
sure i will :)

but still i´ask myself why the enemys arent the level of my teammates most of the times. this cant be fun for my mates in these games and thats why they go afk or go toxic and dont info probably.

but as you already said i should focus on coming out, out of gold and getting higher ranks, where are more people who know how to play this competetive game :)
Peace was never an option 🪿
Please attach a vod or your tracket.net ID
What's the lore behind the callout in cs?
Vandal: Forsaken, Xerofang, Gaia

Phantom: Oni, Spectrum, Recon
In this game it’s safe to say that age is just a number, you can go for it if you want. Me personally did not try a coach before because I feel like just watching videos is more than enough for me, it’s obviously different for everyone but I just say what works for me.
Xenon Bow
1500 vbucks? How do I get it?
Now that I think about it, it is almost definitely the second option. My friends introduced me to the game last year but I went through a month or two of unemployment where all I did was play Val and now i’m just much better then them lol. 

It sucks because I want to rank up but I also want to play with my friends, maybe i’ll just make an alt to solo queue with
I say ez when I lose
Because a lot of times these instalock duelists are very bad at playing duelist
I did play that a few days ago
Add Ranked numbers.
Playing with a wounded hand will do that to you. Even pos become trash when their hands have some temporary anomaly.
i have 6 vandals (3 bp skins 3 bought) and 2 phatom, for every other gun 1 skin be it bp or shop cause i rarely use them
Viper is a great agent to try out just remember on some maps she could benefit being a secondary smoker and used kinda like a sentinel but single viper for smokes could be great if you have the right setup I suggest looking up viper defaults on tiktok or youtube to help out with that so you know where to wall or orb and watching streamers/pro players to see how they utilize her then going into custom games to practice throwing the walls/orbs  since you can’t pinpoint smoke something like a brimstone or an omen could since viper has to literal throw her smokes and doesnt get a redo if you were to miss it
HAVEN IS THE GOAT, idk i get abyss dodges mostly, dont blame them though, i hate the map myself
I recently started a tt series where I make myself talk and use comms in valorant lobbies to get over my 'fear' of facing toxic people (something i know many girls in particular experience), one thing I have noticed that helps me is talking early in agent select, so if someone is weird/sexist I can potentially dodge or get it out of the way before having to sit through a whole game with them.

It's really weird to me that some people will choose toxicity for no reason over winning the game tbh. Good luck with your lobbies!
Sure but I guess the big takeaway is that Riot wants people to feel like heavy shield is worth investing. If it was just better value to always go light they'd make balance changes.


It's even possible that the Outlaw was a reaction to light shield becoming more prominent in pro play.
I'm pretty sure after you get into immortal, the rr system makes you lose more per loss to keep the quality of players high in higher ranks, so only the best are at the top. I could be mistaken, but I think I saw a video or 2 on the topic. I'm sure the rr gain would be a lot higher if you were in ascendant.
I had JUST gotten over missing all these.

thnx bud
So its like skye.. but with less utility and a worse heal?
Being toxic in video games as been linked to low IQ’s by legit studies. So no, they quite literally cannot put 2 and 2 together lmao

Do you have any recommendations for people interested in doing so?

Riot never listens to the community. People have been complaining about Deathmatch being too short and too chaotic for far too long and they never addressed it. People have been complaining about Reyna for years and they never addressed it.

If we want change, an organized boycott of skins is the only way to do it.

How do you do it?

My guess is that in Iso's ult, he suppresses himself and the enemy he takes with him, so if Kayo knife stopped him from collecting new orbs, he wouldn't be able to collect the orb from the enemy he killed inside his ult. And since it's the same status effect, it behaves similarly.
I kinda like it, it feels like a prototype rgz or magepunk. It also has a nice pink skin which I think we need more of.
Says the individual that can't be damned to actually provide any actual useful information...
throughout the course of the act you've climbed from gold to diamond. a recent 5-game match MVP losing streak out of the 260+ matches you've played this act doesn't mean riot is "tryna nerf" you. the average ranks of both your team and opponents has increased from even just 1-2 weeks ago. from the raw stats shown on tracker i think it's just a matter of time before you hit ascendant.

but since you seem so bothered i will let you in on a little secret: switch to controller or initiator and maintain the 30-bombs/match mvps and you'll climb even faster!
Does anybody know when will Ariana grande come back
Oh ok
Well everyone has to start somewhere right? By that logic someone is only allowed to be a beginner when he plays the first agent in the first ever game and then has to stick to that agent lol.
Need devilspwan phoenix wielding blue flames asap
why smurf…?
Better, love smashers with hot toxidos that can make you attracted to the smasher
that is very true above asc,below asc its a sh!t show,basicly diamonds 3 have more knowledge about holding but still fail if enemy duelist has better aim/reaction time
It's a matter of preference. Movement in CS2 feels like iceskating and every weapon sounds and feels like a peashooter in comparison to Valorant. Maybe it's because I played CS1.5 and CS1.6 much more than CS:GO, so I'm not as biased towards CS:GO mechanics

I think OP makes a stupid and convoluted point but regardless, CS maps are definitely better than Valorant maps. Sites on most Valo maps suck, notably Sunsets and Split's.
Yup! Had a duo say they "had to do something at the start of every round" and were just doing it to bait and wait until we died (always came back after a teammate or two of ours died). One was just jumping around as Neon as well as stunning the team and waiting for them to die and the duo wasn't shooting the enemies while they were defusing. Clipped them both griefing and 2-3 days later they're still playing after a report was sent with both clips. FeelsGoodMan
theyre just selfish and want a rifle on third round. no patience to bonus and wait one more round to have a stable econ. only exception being if they're lurking, then it's alright.
I got EU ps5 code
Are you okay in a sense that rank is no where measure as NFL. If you want a better idea on how to scale it. Valorant Rank should be treated as how you progress in sports. High school team = low rank , College team = mid tier rank, Low tier League = High rank, and Professional Leagues = Pro rank. Did you even read my comment  cuz yeah if you want to play the game to the highest level which is pro play and there reason people watch it and same as the NLF cuz it’s game being played in the highest level. You say this logic doesn’t make sense because you put the variable NFL player = Average joe when it’s should be it’s own variable. Let be honest there are people who play unranked Valorant for fun so it’s doesn’t even make since that correlation. In fact your logic doesn’t make sense since you treat NLF league as Valorant ranks which doesn’t make sense as how I put Valorant rank into division. Like you need to understand the term professional they play the game correct and don’t suck compare to average Joe who does suck cuz they are just playing the game for fun. I don’t know why your so fixated on top 25 when some of the top leaderboards player get smoked by pro players.
Get better at the game
my crosshairs keep getting deleted.
unless you are xccurate kevin susanto or prime yay do not play chamber at any rank

I am the opposite I don't want random rewards to try and FOMO me into grinding games. I am completely content with how it is.
Satchelawt... Satchelawt.
Duelist are entry fraggers they are only useful for the player using them tbh so he is kinda right
It’s bc I bearly started playing again and I noticed they were charging me battle passes I didn’t want since season 9 till now charging me with battle passes so I’m tryna see if I go get my money or should I just keep playing :/
Pretty much the gist of it. You just gotta play for the love of the game, because at the end of the day that’s the only thing that really matters. Rank is temporary but doing something your soul enjoys doing is timeless.

I need a lot of Quarts for my traps (i just reached Canney valley) is there a fast way to get them?
Instead of replying how about you just don't respond to them and focus on only the game. If they are really annoying there is a mute button. If someone insults you online in a video game IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO RESPOND TO THEM.

That or if you're wanting to keep being toxic back you can go the malicious compliance route. Ask them what they want you to do. If they something like "play better" that doesn't actually mean anything and they are dumb. If they have a call they want you to follow do everything they say and when it doesn't work it's now their fault and not yours. Now that's not really the best way to handle things but people get quiet or change up when you ask them what they want you to do.
Which is exactly what I just said.
Yeah legit, I mean I’ve just dashed through a viper wall as jett, I’m looking left and right of it to make sure no one’s either side, by that time I’m dead if I haven’t shot the first thing I see
I like the fact that she (they?) can place smokes after dying, but her decay and her ult are a PITA to deal with imo. But perhaps that could also just be because I'm doing something wrong.🤔
And? Keep playing and rank up what do you expect ?
Incredible! There's that toxic vibe captured really well!

I am so quick to mute teammates, but not for reasons like this. Any toxicity or otherwise bullshit commentary, you get three strikes and then you're muted. 

Speak your heart out and mute the sludgelings that are "the future." Fucking morons. 

I just want to have fun, win, and make friends. I'm 32, and this poisoned well, as another redditor so aptly described, is difficult to enjoy when you have a 90% chance of being stuck with at least 2 toxic idiots for 40 minutes. 

Naw man. 

Bro, keep comming. Keep playing the game and engaging. Mute the wastes of oxygen.
Because Val's mechanics are 95% stolen from CS (on purpose), if you can play CS you can play Val.
Woohoojin is cumming from this comment
The thing that fixed this for me was limiting fps in menus, for some reason if you dont have the strongest pc and you let your pc get infinite fps in menus loading in takes a while, I suggest capping your fps at 60 while in menus and seeing if that helps.
In terms of rank distribution yes diamond and above would be high elo in terms of skill prob immo2 is when the skill level shoots up like crazy. I’m ASC1 atm but I might as well be silver for a consistent immo2 player.
[Perhaps this should answer you](https://www.reddit.com/user/Glory_To_Atom/comments/vulg6r/all_stw_changes_we_had_so_far_updated/)
In any rank below gold, your macro means close to nothing, and how you move and take fights is usually the focus point. It’s not just “put crosshair in right place”, its also “how did I swing”, “am I letting my recoil reset between bursts”, “am I bursting and strafing”, etc etc. It would also be nice if we could see a vod or something just to confirm, but for the majority of players, getting to gold largely boils down to “do you fight people good”. There isn’t a fits all solution to this problem tbh, but don’t purchase any coaching cause it’s a waste of money at this rank, and get used to bursting and strafing with a rifle, but there is probably stuff I’m missing.

Bro yamcha is from og dragon ball
I think they are gambling thst they will win the round anyway and can buy rifle next. They don't get that if they lose this round, when part of their team bought, enemy just beat you with classics and can now full buy and you're down. Even if none of your team buys, and you lose round 2, your grand strategy was to play for 1-1 and an even round 3, instead of being up 2-1 at an even round 4.
I hope i can be this balanced when i hit 50 🌟
How do you manage to have a skill issue on a low skill gun
The amount of matches you played literally means nothing. Not enough data, sorry
I'll let you know if it works. About to hop on.
Winning your 1v1s is irrelevant if you never put yourself in a position to have 1v1s.

If you're taking a 50/50 in a position where your team can't trade you you've fucked up loooooong before aim becomes relevant.
kill enemy and don't stay alive after a kill  
outnumbered enemy and slowly take over the map control  
pressure enemy with map presence
I started digital art maybe 2 weeks ago so I am still very new I would say. Thanks for the kind words :)
That would be so op, push up and wait for enemy’s rotation, then push up when they pass
It’s a new mode so it takes a minute to get people where they need to be

Do you buy aries on light buys?
I duo q and trio q, and i totally think there should be a solo q only, for one when I play in a trio we only get solo q for some reason and the team always has really bad chemistry, and when I play in duo w I’ve noticed that im always the only person who comms as the other duo doesn’t talk and the solo q also never talk, this is ofc not to shit on solo q, bc I understand it must be hard to solo w trios and duos, as people in this game are awful, but it’s honestly hard to play w people who don’t comm, and in this case the op said he was the only one who did calls, but in my lobbies w solo q very very rarely they comm which is frustrating
I loved the canny story (I hated the quests)
Lmao
Some people also stop grinding ranked for a while and then come back, but the game puts them in slightly below their peak. Of course if you actually deserve your peak you will win majority of your games in these lobbies and quickly climb.
Yes, you'd be on thin ice. You need to stay out of any sort of AFKing and eventually enough time has passed or so is my assumption and you'll just get some warnings or light penalties.
tracker?
I play both
Not dying at all, but it's a game in my opinion that lacks in a lot of things and harder to make a bond to. As an example i stopped playing this game and Fortnite some time ago and became an addict to BDO. I recently started playing both of those games again because of my gf and let me tell you, I don't feel like wasting a single euro on Valorant while I don't mind in Fortnite (i throw tons on both of them in the past). It's not like I don't like the game, i play it every single day now again, but it doesn't give me the same feeling of excitement I get from Fortnite with everything they do constantly (not to mention how fucking expensive Valorant is compared to Fortnite).
By the time you get a chance to react. You're already dead. They just had to click and fire as soon as you walk into sight.
Amazing update! Now I should finally be able to build in those couple spots in the tunnels in my Canny storm shield. Hooray!
Have you checked to see if this happens for other people? Cause I have another repeating visual glitch when I use my glitchpop vandal, sometimes it'll show the little screen thing on my pistol, but this doesn't happen for other people.

Imm3 perspective here, Ive only played ISO since his release this act. I am sitting at 220 rr at the moment.   
1. His Vulnerable ability is incredibly strong with Raze nade, Shockdarts, etc.. Like really strong  
2. Double tap is (IMO) a better version of reyna heal. Being able to take an op shot is very strong.   
3. The wall needs changes, its very slow, doesnt move with terrain (vertically) , and feels out of place. Maybe speed it up/change the animation speed of deploying it  
4. The ult can be VERY strong in niche situations, but ive mainly been using it to secure rounds against ecos, postplants, and killing ulting jetts/chambers who dont buy guns. Its a fun kit  


overall I think hes good but hes a more supportive duelist.

Because open space means you're susceptible to crossfires and in general vulnerable.  Breeze is a map where no agents can really stop open space from being something you're gonna run into.

OP is more of a problem since tube and mid changes since attackers are super funneled through 4 choke points if they want to attack anywhere.
I bought one season pass one time
Every time I buy stinger I doubt it's efficacy, and every time I get at least two kills with it. It's like anti-confidence and I don't know why it works, but it does
Its such a frustrating tip, since its not something you can actively do much about, but over time you will subconciously notice patterns, timings, strats and mistakes of enemies, teammates and yourself and become a better player.

It takes a different amount of time for everyone, and some will have an easier time improving than orhers bur if you continue playing, most likely you will see improvement too.
When talking about exaggerating, I meant the 99% part, it’s obviously less than that. 

Switzwerland and Austria ok, we happen to agree for these two. 

Then you sacrifice ping for language for France/Paris and Poland/Warsaw which doesn’t agree with your original point but sure. 

After that you make no sense, you sacrifice your precious ping to throw Czechs all the way to Warsaw servers when Frankfurt is right there? Was this a question of ping or not? And why are you sendin BEL/NDE/DEN to London? They don’t speak English as their primary language and are much closer to Frankfurt. Wasn’t the problem the higher ping?

Your problem isn’t solved and you are just creating a bigger mess. 

I’ve met German people who refuse to speak English, stop blaming Turkish people only. People from all countries do it. 

Racism isn’t about ”races” as there are none for humans, racism is (among other things) about discriminating specific ethnic groups which you are doing. 

Apart from the racism, I understand your frustration with the server system but there isn’t a way to make it better, at least not with the current servers.
People abuse smurfing in every game existing. Like if you give people the chance to pwn noobs for fun, they will do it.

Content creators play a minor role in this, but hey, creating drama is the most basic way to gain cloud, so good luck.
Pain train is better than both

Ahh okay my bad man, well to answer your question yes for Reyna, yes you shoot faster, use your abilities quicker. And Kay o just suppresses the enemy’s abilities and allows your team to pick you up after being down
Maybe u should Switch Ur Agent or Look for some aim Videos. They explain much Like "lines in head high, Swings, control/avoid spray.
Something Like this. It helps improving

I remember Research tokens because there were two, and I used both. I was nearing max FORT at that time, and I experimented with putting all points into one, only to then realize they had max caps, and there was no point in distributing them anything but evenly. So I used the second token to put it back how it was.

Upgrade tokens? I don't remember that at all lol 
I wouldn't have needed them, and I don't have them anymore, if I ever had them.

I wonder what happened to them 🤔

You know she's either going to top frag, or bottom frag - rarely inbetween. So it's just a coin flip if you get the good Reyna or the bad Reyna.

I like the unrated answer, but if we were to consider actual rank probably plat/gold, large number of players in these ranks + some players who don’t play enough (but are well good enough to grind to asc/imm) also would float down into this range
keep swiping those gerber chicken tenders across the keyboard you are entertaining me. I like how triggered you are to come in here and bash
Interesting, but the stuff is all disassociated, i.e. that turquoise flag you want in the lobby no longer is connected to the turquoise-themed character skin you used to have associated with it (and the weapon skins and emotes).

It's boring. I'd rather try changing dpi and other settings 1000 times and still ask what I am doing wrong.
If you wanna use round smokes then just switch brim for omen he has better range and tp's are good. Also drop reyna get sova. If kayo guy is bored of kayo he can go either sova or cypher or even chamber. Viper-sova-jett-cypher- kayo/reyna. This is goated comp
should of specified it’s for PlayStation (not sure if that matters)
Don’t diss clip! I’m normally clip and normally the one building and finding modules 🤣
Because you have a chance of actually winning the save and having light armor in round 3 is not a big deal, I’d rather have a chance to get 1-2 frags and have a chance to win the save. I peaked Immortal 3 btw, this is a common strat in every match
Therein lies the problem with your statement CommentRestorer….

If it’s possible for Smurfs to carry the game, it is beyond possible for “one man” to carry/outperform the lobby in a tremendous landslide 
- Happens all the time….

Stochastic based algorithms are very accurate and considering the performance of all players in this lobby, yes…. The game most likely came down to “team” performance.

But that point is immaterial as individual performance swings the game all the time.

Also, 3 additional wins means greater economy for his team and less economy for the enemy which can result in an exponentially different outcome
Somebody apparently can’t work with women either it sounds like.
Breach is one of the best agents in the entire game at any elo for any player in any map or situation, he's just not used much because people don't take the time to watch a few guides on him and learn his lineups. Pair a Breach with an entry duelist and you have an insane duo for practically any enemy team comp, skill level, etc.
i guess i needed more emojis to make it obvious
Could I grab a link?
Well good thing epic games won’t be accessing your machine lol. Valorant is made by Riot games and the anti cheat runs at kernel level ring 0 meaning it starts at system boot. Pretty sure they don’t allow VM’s to run the game as well.
Idk man I’m silver 1 and get stuck into plat lobbies after 2 good games the matchmaking is so fucked. It just happens with no solid explanation
Why look at the negative aspect of thing, he'd still have a gf
Especially when the whole game is balanced around defusal. I think it will be fun for a hit but incredibly unbalanced quickly
This is some silver gameplay shit
Skins make you play better. Idk why, but after i bought a few skins i got better.


Valorant is pay to win, dont let anyone tell you different
I literally use it as a benchmark for how many skins I buy, if I don't have the radianite I won't buy a skin even if I want it. Really wish riot would just let us buy the skin for a dollar amount straight up. I understand the business model but it just feels really scummy and I'd be more inclined to spend if it wasn't.
I'm playing on my xbox and apparently the bottom is cutoff I cant se my abliltys is there a fix to this???
You'll always have a knife with you every round, and you'll pull it out a lot, and thus see it, while rotating,  positioning at the start of rounds.

Also, you cannot pick up knife skins off dead enemies, nor can teammates drop them for you. You are always stuck with your knife skin.

But yeah, the prices of skins in Val are utterly ridiculous, and the store is predatory and manipulative in every single possible way. If I were ever to buy a premium skin, it would be a knife for the above reasons, but I still refuse to do so.
Thx

I enjoy using the obliterator. The hacksaw, The pain train and the silent specter are also really good options!
I’m pretty new to valorant and this is the first pc game I’ve ever played. It’s also the first competitive game I’ve really played as I’ve mostly only played single player games before this. Everything you said is exactly why I’m so hooked. 

I love trying to improve at something in a competitive environment. Being new to pc, trying to improve my mechanics is a real challenge. All while realizing this isn’t just a point and shoot game. There’s so much strategy and teamwork involved. Watching videos on how to attack and defend certain maps and all the different situations that can happen in any given round has been a joy.

A huge bonus has been learning all the agents and the lore. The cinematic videos for this game are amazing! And there are a couple people on YouTube that break down each one to figure out lore hidden throughout the game. It’s been so much fun so far and I’m glad I got into it.
Okey I change group then
The aiming isn’t easy there’s going to be a big skill gap between low and high ranks. I play on PC as well and have hundreds of hours logged at sort of high rank (ascendant)

It runs nicely. The controls are a little hard to get used to but it’s a new game so understandable. The utility is pretty easy to use. Overall I think it has a lot of potential to dethrone Siege which is going to be the main competitor for a console tac shooter
By but skipping to the end
LMAOOO I literally just left league after playing it for 6+ years and got here because I want to try something new. Is the valo community as bad as the league's? Cause I'm pretty sure I can survive this game if I'm still sane after playing league for years.
You answered your own question. Because you were five stacking.
tbh i went from dia2 to plat1 (2 more games and im already plat2), i think its pretty fair
True that. For the record I'm silver 1 on this account right now and never ever leave silver.


On my alt account (I got banned for saying no no words on my main). I'm gold 3.

Yeah I mean when rhe price was 150 you had to buy a trip and was still strong on pistol rounds but now we gonna get 2-3 kills every pistol round again

Yes the starter packs don't get much cheaper unless they release a stw only pack (unlikely to happen again). There isn't much new content nowadays, but if you're just starting out there's plenty of content, enough to last a couple years. The vinderman bundle is pretty good as vinderman himself is the creator of vbucks and the backbling is a unique stw item

Probably Chamber right now.

Yoru is not bad at all.  Its just that most people (including myself) can't play him well. I actually think Yoru is secretly one of the best agents out there.  There is just such a high skill ceiling that you will most likely only see bad Yorus on your team and have a bias against him.
It can even be a matter of seconds or 5 minutes :) There is no need for any further explanation it can be right after a game and a report. What do AC developers have to do with this ?
im sorry but i cant see shit my guy
The stun zone being a jump buff is a really cool idea
I took breaks like I did not play for an act but things didn't change.
lmao that's crazy. I guess either they had weird unrated MMR. It could be that the deathmatch MMR is separated but that sounds unlikely, and also it would probably match unrated/comp MMR quite closely, which makes bronze+ascendant kinda crazy :).
100% win rate on icebox sounds sus

Nothing to do with copium. It’s self accountability. 

My peak has nothing to do with this, though I knew we’d get here. This is always how those reacting with emotions deflect away from logic and reasoning.
I see, almost all competitive games have a rank reset when a new act/season starts to shake the ranking ladder. You get rewards based on the rank you reached which is a gun buddy for your rank (I still think Val needs to give more rewards like skins if a person achieved gold or something like in league of legends) It doesn't matter anyways since if you really deserve to be gold, you will be back in gold in a few games and the same applies for every rank.
If you have iron buddy equipped you can wear any skin. 

It’s the exception to the rule
Yeah. I know exactly what you mean. People in Valorant will just afk or grab bomb and hide in spawn. Maybe deal as much team damage as possible. Do everything in their power to ensure that you *lose*. Counter Strike I’ve seen that maybe twice.

I’ve had bitchy rude asshole teammates who love to insult and argue, and let me tell you, mocking or insulting them in any way is a MISTAKE. You WILL lose. Apologies won’t work at that point.

These players tend to be a Jett or Reyna usually the latter.

The butthurt is unreal.
Not much benefit? Valorant content has been ass and replay system would be a great benefit. 

Also average player would use this too, have you ever had a good play and want to save that without bothering to install third party system? Replay system does that. 

This comment and post are a joke, Replay system will significantly lower the barrier of entry to do content in valorant and if someone tries to be better at the game it reduce the barrier too, wow it's like there is no single downside onto adding this thing to your game.
Xenon bow is always great,depends a lot what kind of weapon u want and what heroes u have.For ars i would go pain train or wraith,for smg thrasher sword stormblade or spec blade shotgun husk buster or ground pounder and for explosive ofc discharger and mayby Santa helper

if you’re like this guy yes [img](https://imgur.com/a/bnNICzs)
I’d agree, low ranks don’t use their abilities enough or at all, at that point it’s just point and click aim
I KNOW RIGHT OMG. Im like "pls enter" and they're like "WHY DONT YOU ENTER WITH ME" and im like "BECAUSE IM NOT A FCKING DUELIST"
only low rankers actually care about aces
I used to always use Supercharged Traps, but I've moved onto using TRO or black metal now.

Supercharged Traps, with all 5 constructors in support, gives you the equivalent of an extra damage perk on your traps.

For smaller targets, your traps are already doing enough damage to one-shot them. You don't need that extra damage.

For bigger targets, the extra damage isn't enough to make them do significantly more damage against them, so they'll need to be dealt with by multiple traps, recycling, stalling or user intervention anyway.

I've come round to the viewpoint that Supercharged Traps is therefore kind of a wasted perk for anything but complete AFK situations. OK in endurance (when not mats grinding) because then at least a few traps are doing a bit of extra damage. Anywhere else? Kinda pointless.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/STWguides/comments/zk1za4/base\_loadouts\_explained\_somewhat\_coherently/](https://www.reddit.com/r/STWguides/comments/zk1za4/base_loadouts_explained_somewhat_coherently/) for a fuller discussion of this.
Best thing is to appeal the ban by contacting Fortnite using the form on their website.

Well they killed one back and one site before so if someone was still in heaven id be questioning their sanity. And apart from that they manage to isolate every duel perfectly no? I mean admittedly those enemies gotta be on crack or smth but reyna just cleaned them up ig
> so as an op'er you dont need to be moving cause you then have to take a split second to stop moving which gives up your whole advantage of being able to shoot faster in the first place.

If you spam the a/d key in a manner in which you're essentially stationary, you will not incur any movement inaccuracy. Try it in a custom game.

We can solve the smurfing issue by mass smurfing, everyone buys smurf accounts and ruins as many games as they can wiping out the iron-plat players making them play sth else. Then ryto will ban smurfs. Stonks.
it’s back lol

i have about 4 hours in kovacs. I am plat/diamond. I mainly use range and death match to practice aim, I should prolly start using aim trainers, I'm starting to plateau with my gunfights in high diamond lobbies.
About the same amount of playtime, i've seen it once very early in my valo carreer, then like a month ago twice in a day which felt insane. No other times.

I peaked Immo 1 but I want to become "Cracked"

Bruh, same can be said about overwatch in csgo ruining the game because its spreading awareness of hackers, and people might not want to play the game knowing hackers exist. I don't agree with this pov that quality of life apps are making quality of life worse. 



The problem is the match making system. In order to maximize revenue, strife, and time played, they won't put you at the rank you're at, they will make you climb to it. Meaning that, if the jet is much better, they are going to brutalize and dominate all those games. Ruining them all for hundreds of other people. 



So now we throw people under the bus for trying to not have their time ruined? Suck it up and hold the Ls, and be an npc for someone else to beat down on? This is some Stockholm syndrome brainworms. Or are you the jet and think other people aren't real and you deserve to beat down on people all day? Even if you have a big ego and think you should win all the time, you have to think about this from the pov of everyone involved. I know altruism is hard, and greed is strong, but have some humanity.

Just by looking at the thumbnail, I can tell you're looking for a different subreddit, we don't have gliders here

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that came out before Battle Royale, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

* Casual Battle Royale - r/FortNiteBR
* Competitive Battle Royale - r/FortniteCompetitive
* Creative - r/FortniteCreative
* Lego - r/LEGOfortnite
* Rocket Racing - r/RocketRacing
* Festival - r/FortniteFestival
* Mobile - r/FortniteMobile (that's there so the main BR sub doesn't have to deal with the lag complaints)

the other Fortnite subreddits only allow videos directly uploaded to Reddit or Imgur/Streamable links too, they don’t allow Twitch streams, TikToks, or YouTube (shorts or normal) links (they don't allow "subscribe/follow me" posts either)
I think Ive seen the yarrr and the love storm ones.  
As for the van one, it looks like we were going on the attack and probably going into a storm zone.
I had thought that might be the case..... didn't think anyone would pick something that terrible to begin with
Basically copied from my cs sens. I used to play 400 dpi 2 sens in csgo. That converts to 400 dpi 0.629. that's what I've stuck with
This has happened a few times before. Like those previous times, it will probably get moved to the correct tab in a later update.
deadzoning is similar to counterstrafing but they aren't synonymous.

counterstrafing is used to stop your movement. this is amazing in cs as the movement is 'glidy' when you let go of your movement key (not a thing in val so counterstrafing is pointless).

deadzoning takes all the steps of executing a counterstrafe but you aren't pressing your opposite movement key to stop, instead holding it one after another. So you never stop moving. There is a couple frames where you don't have movement accuracy when executing this.
I just finished a game where I was bottom frag Reyna with 3 kills, mostly cuz my team was clearing the enemies very quickly. And then suddenly everybody died and I was the last man standing and managed to get an ace & plant. Circumstances heavily influence your apparent skill level
I'm (sort of) instalock Iso just because his E ability. I also play omen and gecko, but im main iso.
I love playing viper (the most ive played with). I have started playing with sova and skye in few maps. Its something about helping my teammates out which i love to do.
Short ttk. I played halo infinite with a friend that was really excited for the game and he loved it, I didn’t. The ttk was so long it was boring, it was like watching a bad movie for the 100th time, and not a good bad movie just a bad bad movie. 

But I love games like overwatch because it’s more like a moba with the strategy’s and stuff so it kinda works
Especially after the changes. I both love and hate making the empress last the whole round, cuz i hate it when i use it and feel the pressure to push or lose the ult, but now i also cant wait for the enemy reynas scary ult to go away
I was bouta say what others have, have someone that’s higher in rank than you watch it. I thought I could figure out what I was doing wrong watching it myself, but my god having someone a higher rank than me watch it showed me I know nothing lmao.
Jing from PRX for me. His Raze is amazing to watch as he creates space like no one else.

Derke is a close second. He's probably one of the most consistent entry fraggers in the game.
I can’t buy skins ? I can upgrade only ? (Without donate )

Depends. My point is there are 2 sides, if console players want to jump in lobbies should be allowed to turn off playing with them. Some people only play unrated, and that’s their fun, so they would need to be able to choose to not be playing with the half a team mate. 
Argue what you want but there is 2 sides to it is all I’m saying, my friend doesn’t touch comp and solely plays unrated but he doesn’t treat it like he is pissing about and takes it seriously, just because you don’t treat it seriously doesn’t mean that’s the same for everyone. 
I can’t imagine how de motivating it would be to launch into an unrated and have 4 controller goons on my team
It’s a good decision for sure though to keep them both separate, I don’t think any console player (especially myself) would even make it past silver if console and PC were cross platform 😂😂
post it to r/fortnitebr and flair it as a bug, then reply to the automod comment asking you to elaborate on the bug

if people comment stuff like “how do you even notice this? this is such a small thing to complain about” then ignore them, the battle royale subreddit just shits its pants when people say anything negative
You can't use weapons that use energy ammo. Also a few weapons like the dragon launcher don't count.
Did you pay for founders? Or the regular game?
i can vividly remember so many people throwing in bronze lobbies when i was there. it’s beyond frustrating i’m sorry :( but the lack of comms is still a huge issue even in gold/plat. my teammates rarely give comms and i have to rely on playing with a few friends so we at least have some sort of communication going
its cosmetic and optional. stop buying shit in F2P games if you don't think their digital garbage is worth your time.
I can count cheaters on my fingers. I remember every cheater perfectly. I've made it easier to identify cheaters. Tip - if you are not sure if you are facing a cheater or not, then just look at his behavior, it is always the same.



Also, if you consider that there is a software that vanguard cannot yet notice, then I have cheaters in every game. But in fact, I get a notification about a banned cheater every month.



And the red screen happened to me 2 times in 3 months.
A term that comes up a lot in these discussions is EDPI, or effective DPI, which is your sens multiplied by your DPI. You're using 800, which is VERY high. For reference, Woohoojin recommends using 190-320. Even your reduced sens is too high for that range. I would check to make sure your mouse is actually running at 800dpi because 800 EDPI should be borderline unusable for the majority of people. 

TL;DR: Unless you're willing to put in crazy aim training hours, drop your sens, get a larger mousepad, and learn how to use your arm and not just your wrist.
A good brimstone is a godsend they carry rounds by knowing when to throw their molly to the spike so by the time the molly disappears it’s too late to defuse and we win the round
does the game give an error code or only what is visible on the screenshot?

I upgraded to a 144hz monitor back when i had a 60 and it’s such a big difference. It’s crazy
What makes me keep coming back is the idea, agents, and gameplay. Almost a nostalgia for when I started and it was all new and exciting. What sends me away is the toxic community, expensive skins (I know generally you can ignore it, but why is this community so centered on them? They're ridiculously expensive yet I rarely see complaints), and the lack of change. Some people might like that, but to me it's a bit disappointing to stop playing for a couple months and come back and all that's new is an agent.
That's why I used to be very toxic in league of legends. Got more than 5 accounts ban while.i was playing Garena servers during my teenage days. However when I see streamers having FUN, I thought that it could be fun as well despite not being a streamer or something sort.
Easier to adjust one number than build and ship content bro
Lol you must not have been that good at cod either. Bad aim and premature reloads are bad there too.
Guessing so yo yeah. would love a wildcard skin card that you could buy or something like that to choose a skin
Good for them!
If you are winning <50% of your games you should rank up because on paper each 5v5 matchup has an almost perfect 50/50 chance for both sides statistically. And if you see someone who’s a few ranks higher than the rest of you, that’s the game trying to force that person to where it thinks they belong. And if an individual ends up in that predicament I hope they’re not on your team. In asc/imm/rad you will almost always lose more rr on a loss, even if you match mvp the game before. But to be at the top you need to preform like you need to be there.
it could be because they started the game before the server was down
I love the Ghost. Used to hate playing pistol rounds, but for the past few acts, I've been frying with the Ghost lol
Me!
Oh okey ty
That’s two console generations ago idk why you’d want to but no, it probably couldn’t. You said it yourself that the switch is like a portable 360. Well STW isn’t on switch bc the switch can’t run it.
I don't get people who queue when they're having a bad day, like, I stop playing ranked after 2 loss in a row.

That's unlucky
I honestly feel like this entire games lifespan it has always been slept on to some degree.

I mean obviously it's not quite as good as the vandal, but it's pretty damn close, and given how much less it costs the economy saving from it can be pretty damn awesome while still easily competing with rifles.

Skye kayo omen in that order
Who’s a reliable seller to buy founders from?
Liten little one,  there is a reason they teach to you learn history in school.  So you know what and what not to do.   The whole reason you think smurfing and team stacking is ok,   is because you don't remember a much more popular and competitive time in gaming when  it was considered not to be.
Eh, in the grand scheme of things none of it matters besides having fun with friends. 

The issue itself is a bit more dynamic than people can tell or admit. So I’ll give you dual viewpoints. 


1) I have a group of friends who love to play CS2, they’re not great. They’re average players. But they’re fun to play with and shoot the breeze with. Two of them have huge egos, and were “the best players around” until a close friend of mine introduced me to them so we could play. I on the other hand, was A+ on csgo when most of the valorant playerbase was in diapers or learning to walk, and now my main and all my Smurfs around between 18-20k. It didn’t take long before they started refusing to play with me because it made games too hard (even on a brand new account with prime at their elo). Their friends also started asking me for advice and not them, like they usually would. Kind of immature behaviour from people my age, who for all intents and purposes should be functioning adults who can use their words to express how they feel. But I digress, it sucked a bit because I enjoyed playing with them. 


2) I met a group of current service members and veterans through a friend who game literally everything, and we have people of all demographics and skill levels. From people with lan earnings to people who play Val with an Xbox controller. We play a lot of Val and CS. These guys try their hardest to include everyone and have a good time, and they’re great people. We played ranked, we play unrated, we play 5v5 customs, we hype each other up and we have a good time. I play on my main sometimes if we’re warming up, playing swifts or unrated, other times I Smurf if the boys wanna play ranked. 


At the end of the day, what I’m trying to get at is that being good at a video game can unironically be an isolating and lonely experience if you’re consistently in the top 1%. Vice versa, connections with real life people who *want* to play with you shouldn’t be taken for granted. 

Just play with your friends. Potentially making Timmy Tenders upset in the bronze lobby is a small price for quality time with friends.
Thank you! I will try the guns more in the range and also try some swift play!
Because losing a game due to bad play is frustrating. It doesn't matter if it's ranked or not winning the game is part of the fun.  Why bother playing if you're not trying to win?

Normal is what it is. Even though you were placed Gold 1 doesn't mean that they think it's the rank you deserve. Your mmr is still high than Gold so as you play, you'll get a ton of rr per win and probably double rank up until you get somewhere around your mmr

you dont understand what you are saying. viper having a sentinel feel was a problem.

"You know what i doubt you can do? hold a fracture site"

i played viper on fracture all the time. I dont think you understand the core gameplay mechanics that viper offers lol
Thanks -- Turret is marked in the same spot in both images, so just to clarify, you put the turret on top of the double-stacked boxes right?
Well I am relatively high elo (peak asc3) and I still prefer the old way, the old way was much easier to notice imo

Why do you think I have this bad Insomnia? I watch this clip every night before sleeping
70% overall, 75% on Cypher
Your point about Timmy only having x amount of minutes to play and trying to optimize the amount of game played in that time is entirely contrived and arbitrary. I could just as easily craft a scenario in my head where someone FF’ing would let them squeeze in an extra game where there otherwise could not have.
Of you get one can you send me on?
I think the unrated modes are also there to try out different things that might look stupid in retrospect.
This is an internet issue, I play on other servers if I want to que with others but I can't reliably mantle except on my local server.
Killjoy players man
I came over from CS in December. Shooting in this game is way different. Took me awhile to get used to, but after playing for about 2 and a half months, I'm finally more accustomed to this game. Movement is really important, and that was one of the thing I struggled most and till this day still a little. Started as Plat 2, now in Ascendant 3, but occasionally I'm still lost. Having experience in CS definitely helped a lot, my winrate is 70+% overall, but there are times where the old habits just slip in and I start crouch spraying a lot lol.
Blind is not a near sight. Being blind and being nearsighted are two different effects.
Depends on the gun you were using and the recoil reset it had. What you described often happens with a vandal. You only want to fire 2 bursts then strafe  unless you are very close range then you can spam bullets. That should also answer your question about why automatic guns exist if you get punished for holding down the left click.

I personally think the gun mechanics in this game are the reason why it's fun to play.
Okay here’s why:

The main thing is her fuel mechanic. A lot of the time, you don’t actually need to take space to force teams to use their own utility (flashes, reveals, etc.) to retake that space, you just need to THREATEN that you might be. Putting up a smoke is a great way of threatening you might be scaling up. Most smokers would waste a precious smoke to do that, but viper can put her wall up for three seconds, put it down for five and have full util and have threatened space. That’s basically the main reason. 

The second reason is that her smokes are REALLY good. Wall smokes cover huge open spaces that dome smokers can’t cover, and her orb decays you so it’s a nightmare to push through. In addition, the orb decay means you can’t hold inside the orb as an enemy, so it’s easy to push into yourself. 

The third reason is she has really good stall potential and post plant stuff with her mollies and orb

 Basically she’s just got so many upsides it’s kind of trolling to not pick her on most maps. If you can find one good wall and orb setup on a map, she’s playable on that map. You see her even breaking into the most stale, established metas on maps like Ascent and being really good.

Considering my gaming experiences with the female friends/GFs of my in-game friends, I never expect female players to not be toxic. I have no idea where they find girls filled with such toxicity. 😂
I don't care if they play on these accounts always together, because they'll reach a rank where he can't carry enough, and we'll need her help. And that will be their duo rank. But if he or she plays later alone, then it's super annoying.

Find a group of people as well to play with on Discord/etc. it helps finding the right people around you that will help each other to get better. In game strategy is hugely important as you go up the ranks.

The map just came out. Give people time to adjust and the "norm" will set in.    
It's simplified the map, made it smaller some, and makes mid pillar more viable to fight for.   Mid isnt just a void for attackers to swarm anymore, or just a late rotators haven.  It's worth taking space and fighting for.  


Also "the off angle" doesn't really make it an off angle if it's common enough to call "the off angle".
Heaven and hell basically refer to high and low spots if there is a high opening on site it will be heaven and if there is a space below it where someone can hide it's hell. Hookah is another location and Neon ( an agent) has her ultimate ability overdrive where she shoots lighting out of her finger. So people call that fingering in valorant.
I'd say Yoru. A good Yoru can be so slippery that you have very little idea as to where they could be.

hiko has been retired for 2 years, you’re using a play from 2 years ago to backup your reasoning?
How old are they? Those really shouldn't be hurting your ears.  I had the same pair for years and it never hurt my ears.

Deathmatch matchmaking will have a much higher chance of “weird” matches than something like ranked. Both queues use an MMR system, but their numbers are independent from one another. Here are a couple factors that contribute to why you might see weird matchmaking in deathmatch:

* Low ELO players often do not play deathmatch, so when they do, they are frequently shuffled into higher ELO games so that they have a reasonable queue time.
* There is no queue restriction in deathmatch. If an Immortal player wants to play with his Bronze friend, it is up to the matchmaker to put both of them in a game *somewhere*.
* The MMR confidence interval for deathmatch is just wider than it is for ranked.
* You might play worse or better in deathmatch than you do in ranked, artificially inflating/deflating your “skill” from what you think you might equate to in ranked.
Peak was dia1 and I'm still dia1, every time I'm about to rank up I get the worst teammates imaginable and it just goes down. Even if I stop and next day Im in with a better mindset I still lose till I'm like 2rr in. Then I'm on a winning spree again u til rank up. This goes on for a while but I'm sure I'll hit asc this season. Just need a good team maybe a duo or so.
My last duo quit on my last act.
🤣🤣🤣
Livvcote. She is incredibly toxic and it’s hard to watch. She will blame her teammates for every round, pick fights with them, and then be toxic the rest of the game and wonder why they don’t win. I don’t see why she has hundreds of viewers, besides maybe that she is an attractive woman.
That is INSANELY high. The "eDPI" ("effective" DPI) is your DPI multiplied by your sensitivity. For you that's 1000 \* 1 = 1000. Most pros have an eDPI between 200-500 (https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/vwh0f6/why\_youre\_missing\_headshots\_a\_comparison\_of/). That means that your sensitivity is 2-5x higher than theirs. **No one can aim like that**. That's a huge part of the reason why you're stuck in bronze. You literally can't aim. Lower your eDPI to somewhere in the 200-400 range and learn how to [**aim with your arm**](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+aim+with+your+arm) (only use your wrist for **micro**adjustments). You'll also need a large mousepad, at least 14" x 14" to aim with your arm.

I play an eDPI of roughly 200 (800 DPI \* 0.25 in-game sens = 200 eDPI). 

  
Good luck
What did pearl do :/
why tf do they care if u aint playing comp
amaaann
Thats how 5 stack boosting works. Their avg vs ur avg is about the same, so def a fair game /s
The downside is that if you want the classic revolver look you don't get the finisher for the weapon as the sci-fi western tier is before the finisher tier for some stupid reason.
I always have that little death inside when I read thing like 'gold is still low elo ' because I never reached more than bronze 3 🤣

I honestly think I might never go much above that. Started playing valorant at 32yo after almost a decade without playing any FPS. 
Stopped playing two years ago and came back now. I still suck a lot of the times but am improving slowly with guides and aim labs. 

I'm having a hard time finding my perfect sens and DPI. Currently playing 800 DPI and 0.342 sens.

Is it worth for me to go 1600 DPI and 0.17 sense perhaps?
yeah it's honestly annoying as shit
It's fairly simple
Probably a fast learner
The game has high-highs, and low-lows because individual skill can affect the game greatly. This makes people chase the high of that game they carried, but they are still subject to the lows of that game where you (or a teammate) performed so badly that you snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
get a headset, any brand name one will do

directional sounds give a massive advantage in the game
I have a code if anyone wants to play in downloading rn PSN
Yeah, astra would be good at stopping defuse too. Sorry astra mains ✌️
Except it's not a competitive game. It's a casual unranked game with no stakes whatsoever. I would have understood if you were playing competitive
Death Watch is pretty cool but they got hardstuck Beskar 1

^ Id keep it for collection purposes tbh. If you want to use the weapon id get another new copy of it.
I'm 800dpi 0.5 ingame, which is slightly above the standard pro sensitivities. I thoroughly recommend using a similarly low sens, playing on a high sens is just playing on hard mode for jo reason
Arguably the best weapon in the whole game. Honestly nothing is must in the game but you also won't regret crafting the Plasmatic
Why the heck would you opt out of traps?


How about instead try recovering data with traps and with obliterator/neon snipeys?

"OH u think its easy? Try no guns no builds!!!" Haha. I did one too.
Do i just join the server ?

We run from it so that we get to keep the gun. This helps save credits.
Peak bronze, I just started playing ranked like 3 days ago but I've already had a shit game streak and it seems like I'm going back to iron 3
Yeah other people murder, I should too 😀
I'd give away a kidney to get rid of Breeze, it needs a real rework and not just opening and closing A halls.
Yea they are only 66% stupid
kuronami, kuronami white, kuronami black, kuronami red
Hard to say.  Definitely OG Skye > OG Kayo in solo queue ranked, but Kayo lineup flashes are much harder to dodge and anticipate than Skye's flashes
you can join a discord only girl’s server called starless, lots of people play valorant together on there so i highly recommend and everyone is soo nice there
I'm well aware of that. My question is if he still gets a shield from the orb as well after killing someone.
Lol!
You aren’t going to get a founders code. People will rip you off. And it isn’t worth it, ever.
200fps isn't a problem.... doesn't matter if you have a 240hz monitor or 1000hz monitor.... if you have reflex on, you're already better off. Higher frame rates isn't going to matter at all, and you're delusional if you think otherwise... "but but but..." seriously, there are people kicking your ass with 60hz monitors...
0 would be more than enough for someone who plays it just for vbucks

have you thought about the fact that maybe people CAN'T get a PC? you're telling them to "just make an investment of close to a 1000$ if you want to play on kbm" do you réalisé how utterly brainless you sound, being so angry for no reason? if kbm was added it wouldn't change a thing to controller players if they had different queues, but still you get mad for no reason and make the world a more bitter place than it already is. Bravo! 👏
No, unless they are Plat and smurfing in Bronze, it's easy to tell.

You pick and you die right away? They are clearly a smurf.
My guys looking for validation because he dropped so far lol
At first, I didn't see the bottom part of the gun buddy and thought to myself "We're getting Airpods now"?
Why are y’all posting to this satire.
I have been using them for years because they add another layer of defense, for exapmle edited floor+ramp+wall is 3 layers of defense in a single tile
phoenix split ez bag
Your crosshair shouldn’t be on the absolute corner if you are anticipating a swing, only person that does that is tenz and you can guess why it works for him. Also your cross hair shouldn’t be aiming at the wall ever(when you first made contact) keep it tracing an angle/ possible position ALWAYS
There seem to be a huge bias towards the B site for attackers. Going to A is a nightmare since attckers need to deal with a very annoying crossfire right off the rip and there are no easy way to open up the site from mid compared to B
Not defending OP but actively trying to break his shield with pistol is incredibly idiotic
Might I suggest recording a game and try submitting it for a vod review? I know woohoojin has criteria to do so (x comp matches a day, DMs everyday etc) but having him or another veteran in the game directly critique your gameplay could be a lot more beneficial than just watching a bunch of videos.
yep, but when we lose it does not matter for them, I am the one who caused the lose in their opinion. That's actually a problem, cuz while against us platinum 3 etc., in our team(except 2 my friends) total silvers(mostly).
colorful skins. my fav aesthetic is glitchcore, so it makes sense that my favourite collection is glitchpop.
Bro half of the pros I see playing in vct are obese
Forgot to mention that like half of my team or the enemy team frequently also peaked Diamond, so it’s almost like I’m playing the same tier of players in some matches and then a completely different game the next. Don’t know if it’s hidden rank or just everyone that peaked Diamond has now been pushed back down to Plat/Gold for some reason
if you can't afford a 10 dollar game do you really have the time to spend on it?
You have to wait for recoil to reset, it starts kicking like mad after the third bullet
These issues have been brought to the table many times. The game inherently has no way to punish people's intentions. Ranked is gonna suck because the playerbase sucks, it has very little to do with the way the game is designed.
I'd be angry too if my arm was swollen up that bad... so a bunch of nonsensical yelling and complaining perhaps
Has nothing to do with FOMO. It's an additional source of extra money for StW, you know the thing Epic wants out of its game modes? The thing is too they could legit do small upgrades, go up 1 tier occasionally. It's not like you have to straight jump to Ultimate lmao
I do, but still. It's kinda crazy xD

Playing an organized 5v5 vs running a solo queue or even a premade is a lot different, pros don't play ranked to improve for their teamplay, they play scrims vs other organized teams.  It's the difference between getting 4 friends to play basketball vs playing in a professional league.
Nah it’s throwing imo
Thanks for correcting, knife does 50 damage from front (75 with right click) and a backstab does 100 (150 with right click), but agent abilities takes double damage from knife so 50\*2=100.
This makes a lot of sense. Banning agents per map is definitely the way to go. Sentinels are really strong rn
Hmm. I very highly doubt it's the browser causing the issue, as well. I'm honestly not sure. First thing's first: I would definitely take your laptop apart and completely clean everything out. Run HWInfo in the background of your sessions and see if you can catch your CPU thermal throttling for any reason (even though it's not even at it's peak, you never know) at any point. Then after you get it all cleaned out, retest everything and report back. Throttling or not, it needs to be cleaned, as you stated before. I would start there.
The knife that comes with the recon phantom
A site feels too artificial 
B's fine
They did Snowball Game. But they removed it.

Put it back in the game, decorate the maps a bit, gives some cheap Christmas skins and call it s day.

Or at least put a banner saying Merry Christmas. They didn't even do that.
On the bright side, I’ve seen so many variations of racial slurs in names, so not being able to change it as often will reduce that too
Get better at the game & im not saying it to be an asshole.

Stop wide swinging, learn what angles to hold, play off of your teammates, learn crosshair placement, learn lineups if you play an agent with molly, communicate with your team, come up with ideas and strats for rounds, be an IGL if there isn’t one on the team
ACS. he probably didnt get many first kills as the rest of his team
if for ps5 could i get one
honestly its a really fun but difficult sport that is very "at your own pace". Ive tried it a few times, can definitely recommend. even if it is a meme lol
Also using a tracker also increases my confidence knowing that most ascendant players are just boosted pieces of shit.
You're mad that people are having fun in a video game?
I lost 1 rr one time in like a quadruple overtime where I went like 12/30 on my first Fade game lol.

I think the highest I ever got was 4 or 5
I'm pretty sure there's a non-negligible correlation between rig power and ranks lol but y'aint gonna get enough responses for anything statistically significant
You're not losing rr cause of leavers, you are in the rank you belong and statistically you will always be in the rank you belong. If you blame either leavers or smurfers for your rank you are indeed a crybaby and it is just a skill issue.
I played last month and a few times prior. Idk why I just could never find hardly anyone on the servers anymore it's super weird
Yeah, already had enough of those
I think that the wire blocked the ult.
Thanks for the laugh XD

Lol nice shots. It seems that you like the inspect
It's still a glitch because husks don't see this as regular blockoff
Immortal and it's not close (shit is impossible how is this high elo💀💀)
Just watch woohoojin on youtube. Best valorant ranked coach, he's entertaining, friendly, and educating

He's currently not the top rank (radiant) right now, but don't let that make you think he's the best coach. He studies pro players in ranked games and is friends with someone who's hit rank 1 radiant who agrees with his teachings (the rank 1 radiant is dopai, he also coaches I think, but personally I don't think he's as entertaining as woohoojin)

Just look at his most recent month to gold video, and you'll have everything you need to get better at the game

Do NOT go to proguides or tiktok for coaching, they high key suck and will make you more confused at the game
It's very hard to win trade in a game with so many players and where you can't choose the enemies especially in low elo where you have so many active players.

It's just possible that you endedup in a game with derankers, derankers are a type of smurf that hard stomp on some games then hard throw on others, it's possible but unlikely to win with a single deranker, when they are duo+ it's unwinnable.

Derankers' general purpose is to boost other people so they keep their rank as low as possible. Then when they play with the person they are boosting, they hard stomp the lobby.
Anyone received them yet?
I personally don’t know a single person who likes any of those skins (ig some like the melee bc it’s troll and kinda funny) but to throw over that is crazy (especially if it’s comp). But yea the general community will not want to trade with u that’s true haha
They'll likely never add a new zone. Best we can hope for is new biomes, but that's far from a guarantee.

6* materials were never meant to be put into the hands of players. That happened due to a screw up on Epic's part and they became widespread becauss people duped the hell out of them. 

At one point a long time ago Epic also said that if they ever did decide to ads 6* gear to the game, it'd use entirely new mats instead of the ones people managed to get because of their screw up. Kind of a moot point now, though. If there was any chance (however slim) of 6* gear being added, it's probably safe to assume that it died when superchargers were added to the game.

The main story is finished. Epic stated that back in 2020. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

At this point, the best we can hope for are rare surprises of smaller pieces of content. Mostly new heroes and new weapon sets.
I watch content subconsciously O_O?

You end up making more vbucks though. 30 more vbucks from each daily adds up quickly.
I agree. I'd say 70% my comms experience in Valorant is weird at worst and positive at best and 30% of the time it's non existent to downright toxic. Very rarely do I experience true toxicity in VC. Usually it's the enemy flaming in all

Kay o. He's a cs players easiest and most enjoyable transition
This is insane, was the server only had 100 players or what? 

Matchmaking couldn't find anyone and just fill the gap I guess.
I just went from 24 to 27 and it wasnt a problem adapting. Both sizes have advantages but im happy with the switch.
yes but let me play out a situation for you: there is no sage on your team, and u can 1 tap everyone but you have 1 bullet:  


situation 1: you are playing as jett and u 1 tap someone and another teammate peaks you as soon as u need to reload and since u have to reload ur only option is to try to dash backwards out of the situation or die

&#x200B;

situation 2: you are playing as reyna and the exact same thing happens as in situation 1, but now u have a dismiss so now u can get out of there and reposition with no reprocussions and then reload and one tap the other enemy.  


see the difference? in 1 situation u are almost guaranteed death bc you have little to no way of getting out and in the other, you have a free way of getting out. if you were playing as any other agent you peobably would've died unless u were playing as yoru and just happened to have a tp setup or playing as chamber and just happened to have a tp within range setup, ur pretty much screwed in that situation. reyna's kit not only allows her to dominate any battle where she outaims the opponent, it allows risky plays that with any other agent would almost certainly result in death. and dont even get me started on her ult, if she ults at the beginning of a round, she gets a free heal and a free dismiss (which makes her invisible) for every kill she gets basically allowing her to ace super easily. 

and i know these are more specific situations, but similar situations can happen with the basic idea of "reyna do stupid thing, come out as long as 1 kill, any other agent do same thing, ends in most likely death"
Never played it but I’m up for new things lol
Idk about Valorant, but Caffeine is the most effective pre-workout stimulant (all the other stuff in pre-workout is magnitudes less important). 

But it’s really easy to build caffeine tolerance so you’re gonna get the most out of it by cycling off caffeine for 2-4 weeks every few months.

The only downside is that you really have to be careful to not let it effect your sleep. No caffeine within 8-10 hours of bed time. Not getting enough sleep will effect your performance and progress negatively far, far more than caffeine effects your performance positively. So just be careful.
if I remember correctly there wont be any skins in that shop, and yk its named "accessory" shop (correct me if I'm wrong)

Its not about load. Mumbai server can handle quite a lot. I don't think we've that player base right now. Riot use their own servers for matchmaking, but they host their website, merch, and more services on AWS.
Southie for energy. There is a ventures mode where you don’t have any energy till you get kills and he is clutch in any loadout there. 

Plus great for farming or running earsplitter etc…

Can you link your tracker?
I’d say reaver or Gaia
Bronze or low silver
Forcing round 2 in Valorant isn‘t as high risk as people think it is. The stinger is a really good weapon. Also even if you lose you get the second round loss bonus which is 2400. Assuming you get some kills on your force then this should be okay for the anti-bonus.
But my classic D:
Honestly I might just stop playing competitive FPS in general unless my pals find something that intrigues me

I’m always hearing You are a bear lol
Try not to not play for a month, and then come back, you will have some rust, but a new apreciation for the game and your aim will reacostume to the sens, and that could make your aim better
The answer to your question is no, Hang Time doesn't affect Kunai damage.

*Using Kunai Storm grants hover for 4 seconds.* Then, when in hover, your damage is increased. You have to do the Kunai to activate the hover, so no, it doesn't boost your damage during Kunai.
What about during the site take ? Do they lurk or play with the team most of the time?

Also. Do they place the mollies as the spike is planted or do they play lineups?
head torso legs are the 3 zones, only legs doesn’t kill on op

smurfing is deliberately losing rank, and even staying in a lower rank to shit on them as a higher ranked player. im not staying down there. at least not on purpose. and alt is an alt. a smurf is a smurf. and sometimes its nice to play the game without having friends inviting me to join them.
I mean in the states that is like a month or two of work at a shitty fast food place and you good to go.
It seems difficult to write this into tos without accidentally including things like Valorant Tracker
Well.....it is true.
Your role would be a duelist then mostly. 
Since u started played with brimstone u could play the newest agent whats a controller (similar to brimstone) but u can also play her aggressive. What would be a quite good pick for yourself.
Kind of like how it's unfair Raze gets to shoot a rocket launcher at an enemy with her ultimate. 


Iso having an advantage makes sense.
I just picked her up and it’s insane how good she can be!!
I’m not saying it’s a good thing, but it’s really barely an inconvenience.

CS is just the best FPS out there, a minor inconvenience won’t change that.
In low elo is doesn't matter just plant that shit. In coordinated play then you usually give the spike to the valuable ults like KJ, Jett, Viper, and Sova.
Yuh huh I can go real fast and hold 4

U won't need to if you can take their spawn faster
Kayo flashes everyone of his team with his robotic schlong

Maybe with the change of rarity they will stop being available in missions 4ever?

A bigger flex is that since this post he would have made so much vbucks from stw if you actually play BR you didn’t waste money you just paid more but get the vbucks back overtime
there is no "good sens"

pick the highest sens you can control and you are good
It is a low meshes issue. I play BR with low meshes and turn it off to fix this for stw. Just go to high meshes and you're chill.
its still hard to believe chamber was pre firing for so long and givin away position
You're on the Asian server....  let that sink in and you got your answer....
I’m happy for u… or sorry that that happened
Hang in there, buddy! It's like they say, patience is a virtue...and a test of sanity. 😅🤞
Yeah its peoples choice, both sides are very understandable here. And im honestly on the fence on to what extent I'll support him going on.

(If he hits radiant onstream ill drop a prime sub lol)
I'm immortal on my set up, I'm gold on my brother's. Yes setup matter, but it's not that hard to have a optimal set up. All you need is a light mouse, a big mousepad, and a nice monitor.
Depends alot on the map tbh, on fracture and lotus it's pretty much a crap shoot 90% of the time anyways so hearing some obscure lurk isn't a big priority.

On like split or pearl thought no it's super important to be listening for stuff on that map.

Still happens in low ranks constantly, i hate explaining "healer" is not a role that needs filling
As a former iron player that is not in plat, I can tell you with confidence that it was probably your teammate's fault. With that being said, this is an extremely unhealthy mindset to carry as a low ranked player (I know because I felt the same way). If you view your bad teammates as the reason you can't rank up, you will never improve. Think of Valorant ranked games as a statistic instead of separate games. If you continuously play better than other players your rank, then you will rank up, simply as a matter of probability. After all, the bad teammates you get are bound to be on your opponent's team, right?

My favorite weapon to buy when on a loss streak. 2900 is perfect for guardian + half shield and no util refills since I never use them anyway.
Imo escaped is horrible, punishes you for them getting stuck when they shouldnt

It’s weird that fade seize doesn’t hit teammates but deadlocks nade does. Just another reason why she isn’t that great
Haha thanks. The reason I added that small video clip at start is because I knew people will think the photos are AI or all photoshopped. So decided to add a clip without any studio lights, just a closeup of my work.

FYI, unless it's been fixed recently, affliction damage isn't working properly.
There is a difference between hard and complex. And even more differences between hard and hard.

A task could be considered hard if it requires immense effort to pull off, while as a task might be considered complex if there is lot of different parts etc required for the task to be completed.

The most complex agent is likely astra, whj will not even review astra gameplays as coach until immo since its so unintuitive for beginners and intermediate players.

The hardest agent would have to be reyna. She provides pretty much no utility apart from leer unless there is a kill which makes her have to rely entirely on skill whether that comes from aim, game knowledge or teamwork, no press to x here.

HOWEVER,

You could also say that the hardest agent would be the one that pros can not make work (for whatever reason) at the highest level. So for example jett cant be considered hard if its played all the time, but e.g reyna would be "too hard" since nobody plays her at VCT (or extremely rare). In that case tho there would be a few other agents as well, afaik deadlock, gekko etc.

You could also argue that the hardest agent is the agent that is played by the mechanically best players on any given pro team. In that case going by mechanical skill it would be duelists such as jett/raze, other duelists dont see much pro play. The same way you could argue that the hardest agent would be the one that requires the most coordination / thinking to pull off, but since usually that heavily depends on IGL I consider that too subjective to actually rank fairly.
As a viper enjoyer I love pearl and Breeze since I can get called a lineup larry by my silver enemies while viper is still viable as a solo controller. Fracture is also pretty nicre, because Breach, Skye are viable. I hate the 3 site maps. Ascent and Sunset are also pretty decent. Don't have that much ranked experience on Icebox (Bring back Icebox and Fracture and remove the unbalanced abomination that 3 site maps are.)
People don't do that in even bronze and iron lobbies . I know not to buy after losing pistol rnd from like iron
reyna can overheal back to 150 so theoretically she could tank like 7 marshall shots in one round
I edited my post to add more information so I can convey my point across more accurately. I can't "edit my posts" this guy says. Why not? 

Was the logic of my argument so irrefutable that you're giving up and using my "editing" as an excuse for your defeat?

I'll tell you why. You have no logical argument against what I'm saying and you never will because you're simply lacking knowledge and you're wrong. 

You are probably one of the noob ranked players I talked about
It’s a process, you’ll get better over time
Tdm might be better for you to warm up for now and when you get better you can go straight to dm
Ummm, no?
I also started playing Counter-Strike when I was about 13. I’m 34 now. I grew up on 1.6 and VALORANT feels truer to 1.6 than CS2 ever will be.

TBH I also love that VALORANT does cater to players who don’t want to/don’t have the time to learn line-ups. In CS lineups are basically required. In VALORANT, there are Agents who don’t require any lineups, and as a dad to young kids: This suits me perfectly. I just don’t have time for learning lineups anymore.

I think that every time I watch an old stw video lol
Yaaaas
yeah but cypher is great so it's clearly possible
Why? What did they do?
So heres the thing, Kayo in low elo is almost useless.   


Low elo teams are not gonna know how to play off your utility and your going to find it hard to rank up playing with him just saying.  


his flash is fine :p             Its not that it dont last a long time, its that the enemy dodges it then peaks you because you think hes blind  


I do agree with the nade , its complete ass and so much weaker than a viper , brim, or gekko molly.   


At the end of the day, he prolly does not need buffed

Instalock Peach or Toad. And avoid initiators like Bowser.

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, the PvE mode that came out before Battle Royale, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

* Casual Battle Royale - r/FortNiteBR
* Competitive Battle Royale - r/FortniteCompetitive
* Creative - r/FortniteCreative
* Lego - r/LEGOfortnite
* Rocket Racing - r/RocketRacing
* Festival - r/FortniteFestival
* Mobile - r/FortniteMobile (that's there so the main BR sub doesn't have to deal with the lag complaints)
It's because of posts like these that I decided to put my Riot gun-buddy on my Odin
Umm Riot has been doing that in LoL for years. Most notably and obvious was the dunk master Darius skin. Someone made an app that injected code to show you skins that only you could see (client side) but it became popular for streamers. There were some weird ones out there that were ugly but made your champ stand out. The most creative and well made one was dunkmaster Darius - a basketball themed skin because his ult makes him jump up in the air and dunk down on the enemy.
ACS is average combat score for every round. It's calculated as follows:

Damage: one point per damage dealt  
Kills: 150/130/110/90/70 for every remaining enemy
Multi-kills: +50 per additional kill  
Non–damaging assists: 25 

So if you ace a round and one-tap every enemy, you get:
800 ACS for the kills themselves  
550 ACS for the kill streak  
200 ACS for getting four additional kills after the first one  

So a one-tap every enemy Ace with a Vandal is worth 1,550 ACS for that round only. This is added to all your other rounds' ACS and divided by how many rounds you played.

In your scenario, you may have had more kills, but Phoenix may have had more first bloods and 3Ks or 4Ks, whereas you may have only had 1 kill per round or something like that.

It's very possible for someone to be ahead in kills but fall behind another one who had less but more impactful kills. That doesn't even take non-damaging assists into account.

My friend has the same issue when playing on performance mode
It’s incredibly region dependent 
The answer is bad, in a real game a skilled player just has more game knowledge which plays a huge role in winning games. If you just compare a typical iron-silver player to even an ascendant the game comprehension is just at a different level.
ik that specific scenario doesent happen often but I hate that type of person that just gives up
Well I set it to Fixed, based on side specifically so my brain doesn't have to think too hard and just place smokes in the upper area of the circle. So seeing the map oriented sideways is exteremely disorienting.
Maybe your done then?, everyone plays differently and has different goals.

I'm in the same position end game lv160's solo.  For me the game will Never end. Me personally i want every gun schematic lv 130 and God rolled then lv 144. Finish and lv up whole collection book. Get max PL 145. Have All SSD's fully built for Endurance. I'm not even half way on all that after 4 years lol.
Sure, where do i send?
 Thats the idea behind iso's ability, friend. So probably not more than we can think but yeah, his ability do be shielding 1 instance of damage.
Just wasted money so should’ve read it properly, thanks for answering tho!
I stopped because players tend to destroy things and build basic easy to overthrow and make the game difficult instead of fun and cool looking now I just play for vbucks and wait for others to do the builds and traps
I think the perception of value varies for each person. For example, I bought a knife skin over a year ago, I still use it today and it makes the game more fun for me. On the other hand, I paid 70 dollars for a triple A game and only played 40 hours; I deeply regret buying this specific game. I think that the investment is not just related to the money for the product but rather the value it will add to your life - experience, usefulness, practicality, etc. And this certainly varies from person to person.  
One thing is a fact: skins in Valorant ARE expensive compared to cosmetics in other games that use the same monetization style - weapon skins. The scheme used by Riot is predatory, but unfortunately it works. The last Champions pack alone raised more than 40 million dollars (of these more, half went to the organizations of the participating teams, but still). In the capitalist world, the only customer response that matters to a company is whether customers/users are investing money in the product. Even with a barrage of complaints, if they are buying, for the company, the objective is being achieved. Of course, I'm being very simplistic and there are risks in this specific scenario that I mentioned (of many complaints), but I'm not going to go into the merits of this specific discussion.  
Just my humble contribution to this topic
What's the best way to win comp games with teamates who neither carry nor want to play with the team when you're against a team that looks so coordinated and put together?

> Balancing from an irons perspective will create crazy over powered characters and guns. If you balance from the pros perspective the lower ranks will adapt.

not everyone who isn't a pro player is automatically iron though... besides comp and pro play are almost different games in terms of what characters and maps are good anyways, largely bc of team play in pro settings. ignoring the majority of the playerbase entirely can't be good for anybody.
the long-awaited return of Imperium, but now with finishers!
Didn't the season just start? How are you already 200+? Not being cheecky haha, I'm new to the game.
I read something on tiktok earlier about a program that adds a sensitivity curve or something. I do wish I could remember what it was. Something along the lines of accelerate? I will go through my tiktok tomorrow and try to update this comment with the real name. Sorry am traveling currently and just landed
womp womp
Silver is only a few losses away ;)
Damn bro. I bought it when it was released on PC and JUST completed the whole thing including the epilogue. How many hours have you been playing cause damn
I agree. But swinging off utility isn't always the best idea especially if it's 2v5 and your teammate is planting bomb while you guys are getting pushed, or if the flank is getting pushed and your team is already pushing site.

That's why I said you CAN frag off util, but you don't NEED to. It all depends on the situation. The highest level of skill doesn't just start "swinging off your utility" especially if they are doing it alone.

If the original commentary was playing KJ on Ascent during the Defense side and the enemy team is five-man rushing mid while the KJ trip goes off, swinging them isn't a good idea. Or if the Jett dashes button B while the enemy Reyna leers out behind them while the turret is going off, I wouldn't say swinging out of market is good either.

It's all about choosing how and when to take fights, not to just be braindead "capitalizing" off util through kills. Sometimes, just  getting info IS capitalizing.
Aw man does this mean I have to update it now?
Trying and failing.
Hard stuckAscendant Non-Duelist Main here (ex-iron), comps don’t matter until plat diamond, and even they only matter loosely. Play your Yoru and enjoy, learn more about the game and your personal improvement points. It doesn’t matter who you pick, there is so much to get acquainted with still. 

Source: trust me as a viper main (when she was the most laughed at smoker) do what you want. I now main Raze, Skye and Breach. Regardless of agent, the fundamentals will carry you.
The commenter wasn't directing their comment at the OP they were talking about people who do care about winning in DM
bro plays everything
Hello can i have the spoofer please.
Glad you play daily. Epic doesn’t care. Or care about you. They did this to duck players and hope founders make less credits if they don’t log and play. It’s entirely about them making more money.

They did the math.
yes. precisely
Should probably ask the Raid shadow legends sub, they'll give you that answer ASAP lol.

Joking aside, I'd say there's a small influence for myself. It just depends on the game and the content it provides.
Damn, well sometimes some things happen in a match
Thank the banana who sold boosted accounts and is now a coach who advocates "just instalock reyna to rank up" :)
There's always Jett in that elo so you're good to go
I hate fracture and I’m really happy they didn’t bring it back yet lol but omg pearl yes. I miss pearl. Also yes please delete breeze
It's 4 weeks.
🦀🦀JETT IS DEAD🦀🦀
Damn, and here I thought I made a huge discovery 😔
I think like, overedit, focusing on edits and not gameplay
Not gonna lie...Raze looks so fun. I main a character for 100 hours and then switch to a new one. Currently maining Fade, and I'm thinking Raze may have to be next....

Yeah replays would be awesome, I agree big time. I would love something like Leetify for Val!
Rule 34 artists on their way to update the homepage
I don't think she is balanced at the moment, her C and Q will probably get hit.

C bc it's too good for a non duelist, and Q give her too much versatility at the moment.
Spectrum Waveform but I'm definitely a little biased since I've met Zedd and love his music!
the idea behind the tp is to allow chamber to get q kill and tp to safety without geting trade but not have crossmap setups

TF you on OP? And can I have some?
Clear miss lmao
Perfect, thanks for the breakdown.

Had multiple teammates want to ff after we lost the first 4 rounds, and felt like you lose more for a 0/13 surrender than a 5/13. I really don't see the point in giving up just because the game is hard to win, they will all get harder as you rank up anyways
That's awesome! The transitions were smooth! Great job.   


Thanks for being a fan! (this is the VA (English) for Chamber by the way) This just popped up on my reddit feed.
teddy? at this level? what loadout is that?
this is happening to me too, no clue why
Consider that you've been put down because there's plenty of other people above you who also need to be brought down. Ascendant players currently are potentially peak Radiants since Asc is the highest anyone at all can place after a reset.
Lets take main and get sage orb for ulti with reyna lurk mid for quick rotate on Util info.

Bucky is really underrated on any movement duelist and cypher

Think it’s time to take a break from Valo, go outside and just talk to people face to face
I could be wrong, it's been a few years.
This is very good, keep it up!
It’s not just as bad. You happen on info that You’re gonna lose money, you should retract the bet at best, or swap at worst. But in no world is it as bad as the people matchfixing

Singapore servers usually have people from many countries and most of them are not native English speakers. So, most of them don't feel confident enough to talk in English. So, you don't see many people using VC.

In the Mumbai server, almost everyone is Indian and most people speak Hindi or can speak some broken Hindi or mixture of Hindi and English. So, you see most of them using VC even if it is just to abuse others.
Ive seen some for call of duty that didnt expire for several years
You should record some gameplay so we can help you get better at the game. It’s hard to see what you’re doing wrong if we can’t see it
At this point, riot should switch skye and sages heal. It would fix the issue that sage players (myself included) feel when ppl spam ask for heal. 

It also fixes the issue that skye currently is a better healer, even to sage is healer poster girl.

Also also, the reason sage self heal is so ass was to take away her self reliant pressure right? Self heals isn’t smth we can even do with skye. So why not just make sage the one who can’t self heal ? Idk id be very happy to switch the 2 at this point.

But yeah, the frustration of ppl asking for heals rly is there. I play with a friend (very awake, online in the head type of person) who doesn’t understand why it frustrates me.

Also, I REALLY WISH ppl would learn to hold ALT. U can SEE urself if I have the heal.

At this point, I wouldn’t also hate some sort of UI that shows teammates util, or at least their rechargeables. Can be minimal aswell like 3 orbs / points under their icon both when u look at them and on the score screen on top of
Can you share some tips like I've seen sometimes I'm at back of team i don't bottomfrag but its just that I'm afraid of aggressive plays
Deadlock does not need changes in terms of ranked play,shes absolutely fine.
As a constructor, this upsets me.
If you want to goof around play unranked, competitive is called competitive for a reason. Also if we were winning by 4+ points I wouldn’t really care but when its a close game thats just toxic.
It’s the same thing with every other BR feature. Higher ups probably forgot STW even exists
Play Reyna. They're usually last alive with the most kills before rounds loss.
How long until Viper is removed from the game?
VALORANT has Vanguard though. Riot absolutely can tie these multiple accounts together if they want. If multiple accounts tied together have the same awful “trust factor” it’s not a huge leap to assume it’s the same person and not a LAN center computer or something similar.
they are crazy
Yeh that’s cool that you think that, personally soloq’ing a game like Val is ratshit for the exact reasons you stated, I dunno if you misinterpreted what I meant but there’s no way you befriend 4+ people that DON’T comm, you look for people who are like minded and wanting the same thing, a community, 5 or more players. It takes time but definitely worth it, unless you play at the most obscure times possible

If you just want a soloq option then fair enough, that’s a completely different thing
Exactly!
Nah if his MMR is immortal the game would try to make him immortal as soon as possible so that would make it less RR loss on a game loss and more RR gains on a win. Rn the game thinks his rank is somewhere dia or Asc1 that's why it's trying to make him derank faster.
I don’t know if you’re asking about your preferences, but  it takes a lot of stress off to use agents with what I call “implied value”. Some examples are, in descending order:

1. Brimstone, stim targets are unkillable in that aim bracket, molly takes some skill but ult is easy too

2. Sage, there is no disputing that Sage 9/10 times absolutely stops a push/rush which is common there

3. Skye? Maybe there’s some room for error when flashing but everything else just works. 

TLDR play something with abilities that you can’t mess up so you can focus on positions and aim. :)
OP is a bot learning how to be like human.
once i noticed it i immedeatly played worse, i need the impulse of a kill sound when you get a kill. It makes me so much better

ok, ok. I found another guy who would like to help us
this guy cares about DM stats lmfao
WiFi is fine. The PlayStation overlay controls aren’t laggy. I’ll have to try the usb-c backbone or razer
Man, screw whoever thought a Bot run appeal system was a good idea. Done giving these people any more of my money.

I think rather than having their own team of ppl within the company they collab with a bunch of already popular artists.
Oh okay. He/she probably blocked you to stop the friend requests. Don’t worry friend, you will make new friends

Just look out for the flying cabbages and you should be fine
I think you need to read what I said again
Get off this game bruh
I mean, someone said you get it if you have a rank at the end of the episode and you get your max rank. Idk precisely tho
they should get bonus dmg too i think
7 hours, ~300rr peak
Trust me there are games i go like 10/25 in D1 stuff happens the higher you get ppl will get better and if ur not confident in your aim u will have lower chances u kinda need to have a mind set that u can win every gun fight thats most important part imo
I forgot how goofy the old blasters were lmao
bronze is the "almost every game has at least one smurf" tier. getting out of those ranks made the game feel easier to me.
don't blame u for cheating, either way epic doesn't care about this game + it's pve
If you’re in a smoke, look at the ground and it’s apop flash
There’s servers like that??
People like this need to be perma banned.

Yeah I suppose your vision of Valorant is just different from what they wanted, Riot just wanted it to be a variation of CS while still firmly being gun focused.

I think I may see something about what you're saying, In CS the skill floor(for utility at least) is so low that until rather high ELOs, the coordination is much less sweaty since making set utility plays just really isn't feasible if everyone doesn't know lineups, while in Valorant that kind of strict, structured environment shows up a lot earlier since you just need to like, click to place smokes or other stuff very easily. In the beta a lot more people were just messing around, so I guess the community expectation of structured utility wasn't really there. Is that kind of what you're saying?

Though what attracted you to CS2 more than CSGO did? I've been trying it but I feel it's relatively the same stuff as GO, was it just the new beginning stuff?
In other words, more clueless people in twine peaks with no idea how to play the game.
Cool experiment man, I do think you will need a larger data sample to be able to do proper analysis, but this is a great start. I also think measuring the deviation degree could be really useful, and even taking it to the extreme to see deviation per position. I’m more interested in seeing the results not so much between different sensitivities but rather after you have established a base line and did some intentional corrections as an outcome. My point is.. how to use this data to improve your aim given that sensitivity is not a variable.
what about the guy who doesnt loose any health and my traps dura going through the roof? this actually counters that.
Team comp doesn’t matter at all. Especially in gold. Just out aim the enemy and play tdm.
To second this, is plat considered low elo?
Trading was never a thing in Fortnite. That was a player-imagination thing.  
Whenever I meet newbies, I am normally quite welcome to them, and drop them some Legendary weapons, but always set to the region we are in, like Stonewood, you get level 26, 1-star, gear. Never one of my 130/144 weapons. You don't need that until you really need it, NOT in Stonewood/Plankerton.

On another note, a lot of these traders will be abusive in trying to force you into a trade, by boxing you in.
these quests have been recycled since 2019 and ive done them the first 2 years, why would people do a thing again and again, especially if we have already everything even in the collection book
There isn't even  a cricket in here... you have to be playing the game in stonewood to find the kids who need help getting out of stonewood. they are not on reddit.
>so it would be wasted xp?

No, you can retire them to get 100% of the materials and exp you used to upgrade them
Wouldn't disagree. Anyone can see that he comes first to give criticism and opinions on subjects which are totally not related to him but cannot stand it when someone does the same about him.
i think  you are taking damage
Did they fix the double tracer bug in araxys yet?
[removed]
that’s exactly what i’m saying. how can someone be gold 3 without even warming up? like i try to improve and the game rewards me with nothing. i won’t let my partner play alone just bc some toxic ppl on the internet tell me to abandon them. i just think this game has a huge match making issue and imo every smurf should instantly get a hardware ban. even in iron lobbies its impossible to rank up bc of smurfs…
lmao who responds to this 5 months later.

And its more than it drops off after silver and goes back up at diamond, rather than the percentage.
Ohhh okay thank you so much!
Iron 1 to silver 3. I peaked at plat 1 and fell all the way back to silver. Solo que is dangerous
raze ult should go back to 7, arm time feels too long and kill radius too short
Well don’t expect an explanation then it’s that simple you drink tap water so that’s on you figure it out yourself your brain is like muscle so train it
I can't tell if this is a Dune joke or if you are smoking synthetics while you play.

If it is the latter, that is actually pretty impressive.
She definitely did, way to oppressive for a controller.  Big W imo.
I had to take a huge shit, How am i supposed to know prior to playing a game.
> Say something at the start "Hey everyone, I know my voice is high-pitched but I'm not trolling, I just wanna play the game so please don't sass me for it." 

This is such a mom suggestion, that's going to get you even more bullied.
“I just said random stuff therefor debunked” lmao freak
It is literally never live footage. The accounts get banned way too fast for them to all be live
So you liked getting rare schematics and very lack luster rewards when logging in? The vbucks are literally the only thing they offered, which they are redistributing into actual gameplay, instead of people logging on then logging off. I like the change tbh.
Well ill stick to yoru then
Oh alright, thanks for the info. I still feel like they could've given it a purpose while adding the aa trap
Lol... you drive a Saturn.  What a loser.
I can't speak to your specific team (don't know who you guys are) but in general e-sports we've seen this story play out many times. At a certain point multiple data points do become empirical evidence.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 definately not from you my guy.
Is that the best you can come up with. 

So take the D like you do and do one.

Know the game bro its common sense. Not alot have it as i can see on the comments.
Depends on your settings, it's normal especially if you use CPU encoding
not possible im a val player  but i do shower 2x a day

I can launch but it won't complete and keeps the "dc" animation (walking in place) and tries to go to lobby after X minutes with just "connectin...."
Yea this would probably not work as it's way too exploitable. Though I posted this here because I needed someone's idea on how it might or might not work amd thanks a bunch for making time to write huge paragraphs to explain it. Appreciate your feedback!
What did you expect?
Your recent activity shows you're playing 5-6 games a day? You're def getting burnt out, I recommend playing 2-3 games with max focus rather than 5-6 with "lazy" focus

You'd be surprised on how much I get relaxed by just pew pew people on games. Borderlands and Warframe are my to go to relax tho.
While his Ned and Lars voices are very close, to the point he's basically switched their inflections (Lars originally sounded like a stereotypical Stoner, but that's how he voiced Ned the Eternal in The Long Road Home/Timeless), this would also mean they are ALSO the Hulk, Devil Dinosaur, and Lieutenant Shaxs from Star Trek: Lower Decks.

You wouldn't like them when they're angry...
What servers are you on btw ? I’m from eu and I’d say it’s silver
4 bullets with the vandal does 160 reyna in this video had 173 health
no, but there have been some melee's that are unique and never featured in a premium bundle
Username checks out
 you're probably just using them wrong

The most common uses well to defend your structures for this people usually take a sniper Defender and give them an obliterator or a neon sniper and place them on the roof of the structure, to help deal with flingers. while the nature of their weapons allow them to shoot through the floor and help with any enemies that get too close, although it struggles with thrown Huskies. for this reason, I prefer to use an AR Defender with a bundlebus.

Other acceptable uses of Defenders are more centered around the utility of the weapon than the damage it can do. for instance, if you find yourself going down often, you can give a Defender a candy corn lmg or the ginger blaster, and then as you play, your Battlefield will be littered with healing drops.

Or giving a staccato shotto which shoots as far as an AR, pierces enemies, and makes them dance, to a shotgun Defender for extra crowd control. There are many practical applications for Defenders it all depends on the unique ability of the weapon you choose to give them.

There is, however, one type of defender that I would recommend you never use in any situation, and that's a melee Defender. they simply have to get too close, and their AI isn't sophisticated enough to bait in enemies or to avoid projectiles. so they will get themselves killed all the time no matter what weapon you choose to give them.
I think if Riot wants to fix this, she needs a full on rework, rather than just a buff or nerf. My idea for this:

\- Dismiss and Devour are combined into one ability to make room for another piece of utility, however in exchange, overheal is axed except for during her ult, and it now functions like other duelist signatures, in that it's one charge by default, with another one obtained after getting 2 kills

\- Another piece of util is added that gives her better teamplay potential. I honestly don't know what that would look like, but just something to make her more able to play with her team. 

I understand Reyna is a selfish or ego duelist, but so is Iso, and I feel he's a much better model for that kind of playstyle, having utility that does help the team.
Bro you just posted two PNGs of Sage.
They did the same thing some time ago with Nvidia game filters, there was a bug at the time where if you used certain game filters flashes wouldn't affect you,

so instead of fixing it they removed the ability to use Nvidia filters

The spectre is a better gun but you have to mindful of your economy.

Spectre is just in a place where it's too expensive for ecos but too bad for gun rounds so it's best on anti-ecos.
1600 DPI .175 sens lol
Its not gonna change anything in pro play.. Everyteam is running viper so every team is getting same nerf its like 0 times 10 is still 0. Breeze and icebox were solo controller viper maps and they will stay that since they did nothing with the wall which you need. Other maps are already on double controllers. Only thing riot did is made ranked terrible experience for the team that is not gonna have a player sacrificing their fun and well doing for the team by picking initiator viper.

You're in the Save the World subreddit, the Battle Royale subreddit is r/FortNiteBR, Creative's subreddit is r/FortniteCreative
Maybe next time LISTEN to the Cypher main when talking about Cypher setups🤣
For me it was the other way around. Valorant was my first FPS and at some point we tried CS and for me it felt like the enemies were coming from everywhere. It really is a different map design.
The only cool thing I see in this trailer is headshots which I can do with any gun skin.
Not the ult, the short range teleport ability.
Give clove a dismiss with her over heal. The true support Reyna.
You don't have to, but it is common courtesy sometimes.
I did that before but with outlaw in game half shield is kinda useless and i trust my aim enough to win 1v1 s when i have vandal without a half shield or full since i can just heal after the kill if its 1v1 or dissmiss away if there are more then one people(but it depends on preference u can still buy half shields i just dont want to waste 400 more if im gonna get one shoted by a outlaw)
win or lose at least u have the courage to continue
Can you send me invite via PN ❤️
Wow, you’re a madlad. I had a lot of fun reading this!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but we can refer someone with unknow gender as "He", no?. Sometime I call Jett as he and everyone I play with didn't talk about I using wrong pronoun. And more important is that they know it only one and not confuse like I use "They". I get what you mean in many situation we can call Clove as "They" without teammate confuse. But in intent situation when brain only process that "He/She" refer to one person, and "They" refer to many people. So I hope you also understand that.
What. Send the full traceback, that’s like the last error I would expect unless you changed something
That's why I posted it on reddit. To get more opinions and improvements.
I agree man, it just feels like you are  alone with no info. It just seems that console players can’t comprehend a FPS that’s not COD. It’s frustrating for sure.
please!! been waiting for prime vandal in my store for nearly 2 years now 😭😭
That’s weird because on Xbox i still have the option to buy it pretty much anywhere…. MS store, STW store, BR store
Reyna didn't even get mentioned in the patch
or they were having a good game?? lol
All the people who, encouraged by this sub, choose the "never surrender" option no matter the mode. So spare me lectures about caring.
to be clear, some of them can make very good money, but they are very much in the minority.  but there's also tons of cracked radiant players that never break out of the grind that is T3 which means they make no or very little money.  if OP want to make a living playing the game, streaming is definitely the easier route, especially if they're entertaining.  and maybe you can join a streamer meme team if you want to compete for fun.
Huh? It’s almost always optimal? There’s a reason all the pro’s hold and end up with 4 knives.
If I get 60 fps I'm lucky :(
Woww that actually looks insane. I want it in the game

LOL. Riot should just nerf all agents until the game becomes CS:GO.
Valorant has way better visual clarity and I actually really enjoy the art style. However, the gunplay and movement feel pretty bad with respect to games like CS and Quake. The overall pacing feels sluggish compared to CS.


CS is the same as it has always been and probably always will be. It's a timeless classic and Valve will never solve their server issues or anticheat problems because they aren't incentivized to. 


I enjoy both but lean toward val nowadays as my friends prefer it and I haven't played tac fps games alone in years (or mobas for that matter).
Just read your edit, it's all good, we get lost BR players all the time

You're in Fortnite's Save the World subreddit, a pay-to-play PvE mode where you fight zombie-like monsters instead of other players, here's a little list of the rest of Fortnite's subreddits:

I have also tested. From 10m you can one shot someone with a right click for 200 vs 117 on left click. It's situational but it's useful if someone is just a bit too far away. I've used it many times in game playing SR and it works fine if you're aware of it's limitations. 

It's a niche use but it has it, Sage self-heal has no use or still less than bucky right click does. I main Sage, I never ever have made self-heal be 'worth it' or mean anything since it's nerf. Like maybe on pistol round, if your whole team is dead and you're not in pistol right click range maybe, but that's extremely rare for me. I can follow people at 10m with a bucky every round if I want to.

How about a replay store next?

Where our matches are randomly added to the shop so we can spend our VP to watch the replay of past matches and CATCH THAT PIECE OF SHIT CHEATER TRACKING ME THROUGH THE SMOKE.

Anyone..?
Not really. He's obviously better than me. But I reached plat 2 myself in episode 5. I just happened to started in silver 3 this episode. You can even see in the rank triangle that I skipped gold 1 and went straight to gold 2.
Bro why did you have to word it like this?
idk cant see what ur doing wrong but maybe u added an extra 0
For me the first comp is warm up for comp, not for the entire gameplay
32 - immortal 3
Hi so I'm using this but it doesn't show the red part it just is like a pixleated version of Mt screen and idk why? Any help
Dude episode 5 was almost an year ago. Episode 3 is about 2 years old lmao. Stop crying. They are washed and belong in your rank.
Bit off topic but I have to rant:

I simply want people to speak English in comms. I myself am German and yes I do have an accent, but I feel way more comfortable with English call outs and everything, but other Germans and French players just refuse to speak English, Germans especially. 

London server is still the best server to play on just for the reason that the most English play on it but holy.
Pros:  
It's good if you like it.  
Cons:  
It's bad if you do not.  
  
I'd say wait until last day of night market - if you still want to buy it, do it, but you won't starve your FOMO, are you? ;)
I'm sorry
I think a diamond player should be able to consistently hit 15+

HOWEVER, the bots thing is pure flick accuracy which is only a portion of your true aim.

Microflicking is MUCH more important and you can train that on hard bots.
The way you come around corners isn't good. You're not really looking at anything and clearing angles seems to be an afterthought. You also don't strafe in at full speed you enter straight in or in a slow diaganol path.

You seem to be anxious when in open space wanting to watch every angle at once. Instead watch the more important angles after you've cleared. If someone spawns behind you, you can practice side stepping and flicking around to them off their gunshot audio. 

When you're actually gunfighting you're pretty calm which is nice but your sens seems really high like you should be micro adjusting quicker then you are. A lower sense might really benifit your style. 

I could be wrong but this what I see. Good luck Dave man.
"When will y'all fix the game!?!"

\*Doesn't explain what's broken\*
I was on the the enemy team in the last breeze game, i killed this jett more than he killed me lmao
I mean, yes, and I have ADHD, waiting is not my forte.

Not trying to throw shade, just to understand. How old are you?
Sometimes, I'll hover omen so that nobody else picks smokes then switch to yoru last second. I main omen anyways I just like doing stuff like that
You can’t turn the gekko flash, you’ve got a lot less ammo to spam with now and viper got a big nerf. There’s probably other stuff too but that’s all I can remember 😅
The crit rating boost still works, even if you don't see the visual effects. The actual bug is the healing, so work around it for now by putting a healing hero in support.
As a Cypher and Brim enjoyer, I buy it often for spraying through smokes and one ways. It's also great for lurking, which I do a lot as Cypher.

Also, I like it against eco or light buys for the more competitive time to kill vs stingers at short ranges, while still maintaining 1 tap potential vs light shields.

What I don't like about the phantom is actually the slightly longer recoil reset. I'm still so used to the Vandal that it occasionally fucks me up on short bursts.
Riot didn't invent this monetization method, that's how the vast majority of f2p games handle it.
Don't think there's anything you can do but register again with your main. If you do get it tho if there's any codes none of your friends want may I take one of of your hands
Whenever I try to login it prompts me to make a new account
I cant speak to others but for me i find myself less focused with music. the only time i use music is when im having sensory issues (tism moment and valo guns sounds can make me feel like shit) or when im tilted and the lack of awareness is worth the vibe change that music can give.  


I do think its partly individual though, depending on how ur brain works having some light background noise could help you focus. however i do really mean background noise like u need to be able to clearly hear the footsteps etc
If I catch you in these streets pulling these shenanigans, I'm stealing your storm chests 😂

I think Kk got too overconfident in the end. He did admit to his mistakes in the post-match int, but being so egotistical in an elimination game/ situation is extremely risky. On the other hand, his team (Hao, Smoggy, Chichoo, Nobody) were pretty damn consistent throughout the match. Kk had some impressive shots, but ultimately his confidence was EDG’s downfall this season. (I do say I was impressed watching Less this game)
You were talking past tense.. was obvious. You're simply talking to morons
Greatest advice I was ever given. 

Its not your teams fault. Its always your fault. Until about diamond. THEN its your teams fault and never your fault

Nah, but truth be told start playing for fun rather than competitively. You’ll actually enjoy the game.
Play whoever’s kit you like playing more
Nah I'd blast

>Reg crossbow

i have it first image
No, Jett wouldn’t have it would have been illogical for them to watch CT since people were already watching it.
REALLL. IM SO SAD 😭😭😭 CAUSE I CANT EVEN ENJOY THE GAME NO MORE. They just dominate the game and make fun of beginners. 🙄😒😒
Need a code for xbox Eu pls
Yeah it exists as someone who’s dropped from immortal to bronze before

 if you continuously tilt queue and lose then you will be paired with fellow people on their derank game while against people with lower rank to you but high mmr who are typically on their rank up game (which leads to constant losses since you are tilted , underperforming paired with similar people while against good mental people)
You can’t really brag about building the defences for the objective when you clearly only placed a couple walls. If you had placed a single trap that was killing husks then you wouldn’t have gotten kicked
Amen brother. Thought it was just me lol
this
take a break or hop on my alt
It is called ranked anxiety and there is plenty of material to get rid of it.
No Canny then?
Seems like we're getting a new map next act based on the playercards in this BP & the Clove voiceline tease which means at least one map from the current pool is leaving.   
  
Wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being Ascent but I hope it isn't. Hoping that they also work on some more "back to basics" maps rather than increasingly large & complex maps with gimmicks & increasing number of sightlines.
Thanks, I'll take a look. This is tracker.gg, correct?
I talk but I gor a higher pitched voice and if the teams doing badly or if I whiff sometimes peple like the shred me on it so it’s understandable why some people might not want to talk. Like its even worse if your a women from what ive seen.( most people are good but there are a good amount of roten eggs so it’s understandable that people are nervouse about using voice chat).
Razes satchels are good because you can use them for offense, defense, or just plain stall. The fact that you think they’re good just because you can take space quickly genuinely shows you have 0 clue how these abilities are used when there’s actually some thought behind it. All the information abilities I listed are good whether broken or not. Not only do you have to go out of your way to shoot them allowing someone to easily kill you you also have to reveal where you are to break them. Information will always be more useful than anything else.
Dude chill play it like any other game play it to have fun not for some digital rank and those aim trainers and all that is shit tbh i play this game for almost 1 hour or 1 match and never really used aim trainer and just hop on in comp and i literally ranked up from silver to diamond in months when i started having fun instead of caring about dammm rank
Its your choice. Thank you for proving my point
just learn viper
I would say smokes for solo queue as a role.

But individually as one tricks, yoru, breach, and skye are pretty high ceiling with solid carry potential solo queue.
Play chamber if u enjoy it. If u really want to climb rank, just wait and see what your team is instalocking and then choose ur agent.
People forget that companies have multiple teams that focus on different things…
All servers! Although it is mainly NA we do have several members in other regions.
Yeah lots of fools like that I just mute them and keep on going.  If they start interfering in the game then just leave, no sense playing with griefers.

No one is fully to blame for their rank, no matter what Smurfs and bad teammates will affect your games positively or negatively 

You are still to blame, but we can’t really tell you what to do without a vod
1. [our shop](https://fortnitedb.com/save-the-world-store) isn't so bad right now, most of the featured stuff's mostly for February related things (Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day)
2. the only superhero we have is only exclusive to an event questline, it's just Spitfire with a mad case of meteor poisoning
3. the only collabs we've had are with Paragon (a banner that was around for a limited time, you can't get it anymore) and Battle Breakers (play some arcade games and you'll get some new heroes)
4. why would we vote for things when we could just recruit/research the hero/schematic from the collection book?
5. there's no gold cap, otherwise it'll be impossible to buy a new hero loadout (that "missing" thing from the link above, it's 10,000 gold)

that's still one of the weirdest changes they made lol. most people seemed to either want it back or didn't care, no clue why they doubled down so hard on removing it
Everyone runs faster with a knife in their hand...PSH
Yeah,  I used to play him a long time ago, so I know how that feels
Why don’t you post some links to the example games and players and we can look over them and see if what you’re seeing makes sense.
Ornament.
You get them? Me and my son are trying to play
Will fix a bunch of atlas locations tbh
Yup I was a R6 player too Blackbeard was even more annoying because of the insane amount of peekers advantage that game has

I watched the full beginning of that game. They barely even talked to eachother until then, and after she muted them all
Definitely getting boosted. Just look at the match history, basically bottom frags every game and suddenly drops around 40 kills every game in a single day. 

It seems this player only plays Swiftplay. If you look at his recent Swiftplay games he played with an Immortal Jett. 

If you compare both accounts’ match history you see it basically aligns as the Immortal Jett stopped playing after that last Swiftplay and that’s when those insane ranked games happened. Pretty he just played on his account.
thats what i thought so also, thats why i im confused after my sons laptop got banned for smurfing i think, i dont understand why my account got flagged also from different computer on the same network... and i find it unfair...

Solo it, you'll feel more accomplishment. That's what I did. I had no idea what the actual fight was like, so it took me a lot of tries.. You can "cheat" by looking up a video on it to see what you have to do.

The best melee weapon yo use is surround pound. For the ranged weapon years ago I used the Wraith (assault rifle) but I think the current meta is the Deatomizer.

I'll swap it out for anything with a finisher
Gold 1?
I've been having this problem on and off since the last 2 Episodes, even though I play on Ethernet and never get more than 8 Ping. Both when I try to plant and defuse it just stops the animation and my Agents hands glitch out as if I'm hit by a Killjoy Ult. Also sometimes the defuse/planting progress bar freezes at about 1/4 of the way too. 

Really annoying.
Honestly though, valorant plays really good at 100 ping. I used to use a hotspot and get 90-110 consistently and the only two games that I had no lag issues with were valorant and apex, despite having high ping on both games. It's definitely smoother and noticable now that I'm playing with consistent 30 ping, but it didn't significantly impact my performance playing on 100.
Taking the time to learn each agent, even when I suck at them. It helps you understand each agent's capabilities/limitations and it removes the issue of your main being taken from you.
Fun fact: release Reyna had 4 dismiss/devour charges for 100 credits each. It took a while to get nerfed to 2.
If everyone reports him, then he is gone and you usually get an update. If not, then gg go next
iron 1 to mid-high gold in ~2 years (a LOT of inconsistency)
Clip? Never heard of this before.
No i dont i could take some off you if you dont mind
Yes, it doess. You see, if you right click your Valorant on your desktop, and then click uninstall, life will get way better
I don’t get it
Play gekko because Skye is nerfed.
cool op! if you have a duo would you be placed on the same team?
Your aim training wont translate instantly in one day or even one week, but slowly overtime you will see improvements you just need to stick with it.
Only thing missing from this post is “I tell you what man”
DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. REAVER KARAMBIT is the way to go. I got it 3 months ago and I’ve been loving it. Everything about it is amazing. The animations, the glow, the inspect, the spinning. ITS BLOODY PERFECT.
Log off, do something else, go to work, go to sleep. If I lose even a game or two normally I log off.
enable movement error in stats and see if your movement makes you whiff. if u see the blue lines a lot that means you are shooting when moving so you'll need to practice your strafes and bursting in range/dm.
>kernel anticheat 
What a way to call a rootkit.

Also it'll make porting the game to other OSes (Linux, MacOS) significantly harder.
Omg youre right that is really bad 😂😂

I feel like no one wants to talk about the elephant in the room. They’re a very small team, this is a monumental task because they weren’t planning on having a replay system until serious player pressure, so of course it’s going to take a long time. They need to shift actual employees from one important job to another, there are going to be delays and friction with that, and that takes time.

They have said countless times that they’re working on it, so let them work. We’ll get it soon enough, and it’ll be great. We can deal until then.
big if true. Thats actually really cool. So its a totally even playing field then
How tf are they still iron after 2 years lmao
Drop ur tracker lil bro u do the same thing
Your arbitrary self made definitions for those words have nothing to do with what their actual definitions though.  


Imagine downvoting someone because you don't have access to Google by the way.
We should go code for code
They'll obviously check the account history/logs if you don't state why you're banned and also to see if the information you give matches with the account

no it dont they have done a really good job on everything
As someone that's climbed from Iron to Gold, I'm going to be honest and say I don't really notice much of a difference between Silver and Gold players. The problem with people in our elo is that we have problems being consistent. But that doesn't necessarily mean that the rank above us is so astronomically better than us. We just might notice it more when they outperform us, and psych ourselves out. Since hitting Gold, I definitely notice that I often psych myself out when I see diamond gunbuddies and this in turn makes me more anxious in that match. And I did the same when I was in Iron and Bronze and saw someone that was Silver. 

The difference between Silver and Gold is less than you think. And adding a new rank would just change this post to be about silver - new rank. The thing you need to work on is not letting people's ranks psych you out so much. Because that anxiety of seeing person with \[rank\] on the enemy team is just going to make you perform worse, which in turn reinforces the idea that \[rank\] is so much better than you. With the exception of smurfs, these people are in your lobbies for a reason. All you can really do is focus on improving your aim and understanding of the game.

Well they shouldn’t

Iso. Yet to try him after being buffed today but his Undercut combined with a Skye flash is nuts, the shield (Double Tap) can allow for some crazy plays and the wall (Contingency) is pretty good for entrying but as a solo duelist he can sometimes be hard to play without a Jett dashing in, Yoru tp'ing in or Raze satcheling in. Either way he's a lot more fun to play than the rest imo
Lmao anal beads is a decent description
I get that but many of my friends are plats or diamonds and I play decent with them in customs

^(Have a question or think your post doesn't break the rules?) **[^(Check our full rules)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Valorant/wiki/rules)** ^or **[^(message our modmail, and please don't direct message)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FVALORANT)**^.
hard disagree. sometimes your teammates just don’t play in a way that you can capitalize off of AND secures a round win. 

sure, maybe a bronze duelist will run in without info, but is the right answer to immediately swing and trade? 

what if u only saw the 1 enemy player but there are 2 others on the site and ur teammates arent going to follow up and trade u or help u take space? now you’re 3v4 and u have to rely on ur teammates to clutch it some way somehow.

also… if you’re all brain no aim, you may put yourself in all the right places and fail to secure the trade. you may know all the right angles to hold but if your teammates arent taking space, theres only so much you can do alone. you cant hold every single angle. the only skill that gives you the self sufficiency to clutch rounds mostly alone is aim. 

bottom line is you can only focus on learning and applying so many new skills at a time - brain power beyond a VERY foundational level is not the place to be investing your capacity to learn. 

there is no teamplay in bronze. if you are always adapting to ur various inconsistent bronze teammates, you’re learning weird habits. adapting your play to bronze teammates to intelligently bait is something that requires a lot more game sense than someone who belongs in bronze posesses.

so yeah, as an alternative take - all you need to climb is aim, probably up to mid gold, and even higher depending on how good your aim is.
Omg ur right
to get energy so you can use minigun you need shoot husks with guns melee ??
No one wants your advices in game, and play unrated with your friends. It's not that hard.
Hell nah not again
tell me you're low elo without telling me you're low elo

Damn bro start emoting
Not all IP's can be pulled easily and SOME ISPs these days have DDoS mitigation. He very easily could've been a customer of one of those ISPs. 

Or when his IP was sniffed out his just didn't pop up. IP sniffers aren't perfect and even more so when some ISPs are actively finding ways to fight against them for the sake of customer privacy.


Even if none of the above applied a better explanation can't be provided on how this happened. This is simply the ONLY logical one from an I.T. standpoint.
ACS is not the system Riot uses to decide rating gain/loss. MMR is.
Yea the lack of astra play in any rank including pro play doesnt help the average player base learn her at all, i used to play astra a lot more than i do now but with the lack of team play while solo queueing ranked has made me switch. What rank are u experiencing this at.
Can someone dm me one plz
can i get one! my discord is Highperium
It's a good one way smoke.
Same lol. And on PS sometimes the chat doesn't shift when something is added so new messages aren't shown. I just regularly check every few mins to see if anyone had said anything.

Then at random times if I got R1 it'll pause the game and open the chat and put the keyboard over my screen whilst my person is still running. R1 is to change weapons and has nothing to do with using the chat so when playing I'll randomly get bombarded with that

I don't think you comprehend how bad silver lobbies are.

This is definitely diamondish. 

Also he didn't need to ult there lmao. Better to keep gun out!
When does 8. 11get released ?
Currently in comp for this act 31.5% and I'm in B3, peak 37+%
Duelist ofc. No other way to win
Paywalled tho
ryan u didnt mention u have a coach who specifically hand picked fade for u to play


u also didnt mention u arent capable of remembering the map,  not capable of aiming while thinking of utility, having completely no ability to focus on 2 things at once(in this case the gunfights,utility and minimap), and have no sort of game sense whatsoever.
the reason fade was handpicked is because u have no ability to keep track of the enemy's location and I dont trust u with flashes(proven that u do more good not flashing than to flash).
the people playing with you are all 1year+ experienced players with good habits that pester you to maintain crosshair placement and keep track of utility. the reason I told you to play fade is because u cant keep track of crosshair placement when u have to adjust ur crosshair in any way possible(no matter jett dashing, high reyna leering or anything that requires shifting ur crosshair). I also dont want u to be bored playing sentinel but still want you to have some fun being semi aggresive. you dont realize it but ur playstyle fits fade exactly. you just dont know how to adjust ur aggressiveness and still havent figured out how to play fade 100% aggressively.
I will personally coach u to play fade aggresively and effectively as a self contained aggresive player.
No offense but most if this just sounds like the enemies ganesensed you, you don't need wallhacks to predict a rotate and cut it off. Especially if the enemy team has numbers, it's common to just contain you and hold angles to make sure any rotates are spotted. Blaming cheaters for not being able to rank up is the same as blaming your teammates, it's just copium
Maybe waiting is good. I peaked G3 last act and have always hovered gold (peaked p1). I just did my placements yesterday and was placed S1.  Granted im already almost S3 now and I havent played a lot since... but still. it's weird that it putrs me SO far down.
Unbind crouch for 5d(no kidding, it worked for me) and practice gun hygiene. Wooohoojin has a video on it.
y’all climaxed at the same time
Try some OSRS
Interesting. I thought my 20%-25% was low but I guess it’s alright
I am not a grind type, my mindset is literally 'play game. neuron activation. have fun.' But I can see how rewarding climbing the ranks is, good luck to you as well :)
[removed]
The PTT is the mute button on the controller lol
I would say the best games to review are the ones you felt like you played really well, but still lost. That will most likely expose issues with your gameplay you weren't aware of and maybe you can learn what you could've done differently to win it instead.
Cool
Yes but that only works for so long until the game starts getting stale. And even then i do agree with you but if they're trying to make a competitive environment then they're doing a pretty swell job for sure when there's a handful of agents that completely outclass the rest and those other agents can barely hold a candle to them except In very niche scenarios (jett/raze, kj/Cypher, viper for example). They need to actually make substantial changes so the other agents can actually compete.

Also for Reyna it's just my opinion that she's terrible for ranked play enjoyment for everyone except the Reyna player. She should be reworked but again this part is my bias and opinion

yes, communicate to them when to bait themselves or when to effectively use their abilities, it'll be like you using their abilities through voice command.
😃
All my ranked matches were against Silvers

  
I got placed in iron 3
Idk, but like it says "dp was here" and I thought it was cool and wanted to post it
It's actually a valid tactic if you had inferior gun. I got caught while using frenzy against a guardian and just blitz my way to their personal space. 

Would only work if the other guy already is hiding behind a wall though.

In order:

1. Yes, everyone expect mods
2. Place is flooded with BR players think this is their sub (if you’re one of them, we kindly point you to r/fortniteBR. This subreddit is for Save the World.)
3. Last post was 6 hours ago so I’d say then?
4. Whenever the mods choose to unlock it (probably after the new season hype dies down)
I am really not consistent(diamond hardstuck at this moment for last 8 months)
Never really had a main
And now i play raze on
I really am tired of being in diamond

Did you get pay? Was it worth your time? Thanks.
You were literally right there. That’s exactly how to access them. 

Idk when the last time you tried, but they work now.
It’s not a tracking-intense game, but the importance of tracking in Valorant is definitely understated, for sure.
Is a long way took me years
You do know im a sage main right?
But you are probably at your best like that i guess ? You build your " muscle memory " with years.. Is that hurting so much when you playing or doing another thing :) ?

Why you are not changing to arm aiming then ?
It has that much impact ?? I might consider buying a more expensive one haha, thx for the advice :)!
[removed]
If I remember they stopped working on STW so they could have all hands on making BR better which IMO they have with at least the story lines and skins. But as a founder yea it sucks that the game was abandoned at about 75 or 50 percent completion they should at least finish it at some point but if not we just gotta get over it.
I wouldn't say either is better or worse. I don't know if I even understand the question.

If it's a selection of perks that you're trying to prioritize, maybe listing those and asking which rocks hardest is a better way to go about it.
Ah so there is no actual trading system its just kids scamming you into drop trades? Got it! That would explain why he dropped a gun in front of me then grabbed it when i looked at it. Giving those old Diablo 2 trade scam vibes. 

Not sure why they expect me to have anything at level 7
Not how it works, wrong subreddit & you're 9 on Reddit
Gotta be honest, if someone is hardstuck, it is fheir own fault
Bro, get your reasonable remarks out of here! Where's the outrage! You're over there just taking care of yourself, when you should be in a blind rage! Not cool.

For me the easiest to transition to were probably: Reyna, Kayo, and Brimstone

Reyna: throw flash in the air anywhere without it blinding you or teammates, kill, heal or dismiss. Simple.

Kayo: flash functions like a CS flash, Molly is like a HE nade

Brimstone: click on map to place smokes, easy Molly

I do the same thing!  Ugh, it's so annoying.
2FA isn’t supposed to be some “end all be all” solution. It’s supposed to increase the number of hoops to jump through to make it more tedious. 

If you took a sample size of 100 smurfs and forced them to verify their accounts and only 70 smurfs did. That’s 30 less smurfs the game has. The hope is that some people will be less inclined to do so.
It was in a completely different language I think it was Japanese
That wall is the best, maybe they were looking for early picks that's why they were so angry. I would just continue to do that wall and tell them hey let me know when you want it up. Considering they said it was bad they probably won't tell you to put it up so just do it when you think, don't let the toxicity get to your mental.
Map pools have no business existing in any of the game modes. They make sense in pro play because of the map veto system but for us it literally just makes the game feel more repetitive and worse. No idea why they think we need to play in the same system as pros, especially since we don't even get a veto system.
tbh it's gotten to a point where i'm not having a fun anymore, but i always want to play because i THINK i will have fun and then i really don't lol
also i literally JUST deranked to p1 which isn't that much of a big deal i guess but my career is NOT looking so hot :/ it just feels like even when my aim is good my enemies are just better than me and when my aim isn't good i just can't do anything at all (resorted to judge only in my last comp game after all of first half just getting demolished lol) just sucks because i really do want to get better but i just don't even know where to start :( prob starts with taking a break lol
It's like they just randomly generate changes sometimes 😂
Lol, it’s what I do
I do like the one with Lars outside by his van and equipment

It's where we ask for stuff for STW, even though they'd rather add more content to BR, Creative, and this chapter's new mode trifecta anyway

Hey here, new to fortnite, just joined in season 2 but can you explain what endurance is?
Riot has mentioned in the past that there are some hidden metrics by which they measure people's skill rating. They said they would not share them because then people would just concentrate on those instead of actually trying to be good at the game. Who knows what they look at. Imagine if it's just something simple like using all your utility in a round gets you a bonus. If that were the case and people knew about it, they would just dump all utility before dying instead of trying to actually wait and find good use for it.

 I imagine you are doing something bad that is not reflected in something as simple as stats. Could be something like positioning or timing. If you truly wish to improve, I would recommend you put up a new post with video for someone to review. Sometimes there's people that ask for videos to review for free so you could submit it to them as well.
Eh
idk if was because i was used to Dolby atmos always on, but the sound seems worst now than before i started using dolby im not listing the steps well and the balance between game audio and chat audio seems od..
Bold of you to assume they can read.
Yes, heres ur upvote
I’d suggest running one of the 25% warcry hero’s or Lynx in main slot, I personally use Lynx - Breakbeat - Main Stage Quinn - Bombsquad Kyle - Demolitionist Penny - Tank Penny with TRO for team perk.
Exactly! Especially in a game like valorant where specific information is vital in the competitive scene, using their names is something I've also been doing aswell. 

And that's within your right to care or not care! No judgement held here lol. 

Often times my partner and many friends refer to Clove
as "she" and I dont make a big deal about it. Hell, sometimes I even say "She" when referring to Clove myself, and then correct myself; "they", then just in the end saying "clove's [location], hit [damage]" but, That's just my words coming out more faster than my brain can process whats coming out pft.

I once heard  a couple days ago where my friend retold a mini story when we were discussing clove's ponouns, where he had joined a game with his other group(lesbians) who he plays competitive with and when he accidentally referred to clove as "she" they all collectively yelled "SHE!?!?" and I found it funny at the time, but he's not a bad guy at all for saying it by accident because he even said himself that he *does* want to remain respectful of that community and the characters' pronouns so he gave an apology and corrected himself for what was said.

I just think the apology was unnecessary since it was just an accident, personally.
No prob, good luck
likely have something else wrong, but just try installing the 24.4.1 drivers
I think it can make matchmaking a lot better in many ways. No more boosting, which is getting more and more common, when one player frags out, others just run around map randomly, clueless about what's going on. Also, it may convince some players to communicate with whole team, as they used to just talk with their premade part.
pathetic, go play a different game lmao
there's no HEALER in Val 🤡
Never used Aimlabs and i‘m still pretty sure that range and DM is enough for aim training
thanks
No, but they will at least get out of iron or bronze
He has a strong entry for sure but he's kind of annoying to play now because activating the shield makes a loud ass noise

Here’s the tracker:
https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/penaldo%239168/overview?playlist=competitive

Assuming you’re a high elo player, how about you give some advice instead..
My little kid
I've always been of the opinion that if you have to beg for it, it's not a real ace.
Even non-founders dont need to buy v-bucks because the shop is crap lol
I recently learned that the atlas can be destroyed by player explosives, and that It can be repaired and tried again.
All right, here's a hot take remove controller Harper entirely. hear me out for a second. The way the game looks at trap durability is different from the way it looks at other bonuses. for trap related bonuses, the game looks at everyone in the game's values and only selects the highest value to apply it to the entire squad. so, while having extra trap durability may seem like a good idea and definitely is one if you're the only person in the game, if somebody else on the squad has more trap durability than you, then it's an entirely wasted slot ... the mathematical truth is that trap durability survivors are the only survivors worth using in the game. due to this, everyone recommends using trap durability survivors. Due to this, playing online will often leave you running into people with more durability than you will get from Harper. So my advice is that unless you are playing by yourself and/or already have a full lineup of trap durability survivors, then I suggest avoiding controller Harper.

Base MD is useless it does not heal anywhere near enough health for any situation. But the worst part is the fact that it's tied to the range of your builds. This encourages players who need health to run towards your base, which only encourages flingers and lobers to throw stuff at your base. This is not my advice it's a fact. If you really want to contribute something to the team, then the team Perk boom base may be worth considering

Speaking of team perks, I personally believe you can get better value for your build if you didn't use supercharged traps. supercharged traps is almost wasted if you don't have megabase in your squad. for instance when looking at floor tiles on the same height level alone, a normal base will touch up to 24 floor tiles (not including its own tile), with MB support 40, and with MB main it's 58. this means from playing Mega base in the lead you're doubling the number of traps you can have affected by supercharged traps. essentially doubling its value, and this example is only considering floor traps and is two-dimensional. Once you add height (and walls & ceilings) into the equation all of a sudden, you're getting even more value from Megabase alongside supercharged traps.

Hotfix is never necessary and should only be considered if you still have room left after slotting every other character you wanted. This is also not my advice. This is another fact

In order for Feel The Base to deal damage to enemies, they must be on the same height level as your. my advice be mindful of where you place it.

Base Kyle is debatably the best constructor in the game where he really shines, though it is in the commander slot with powerbase Knox in the squad slot ... my advice is to switch base Kyle and thunder Thora

You should look into getting an Ice King he is a fantastic constructor (and my personal favorite), debatably just as good as base Kyle and megabase.

That's all I have off the top of my head
Hey there, just letting you know that asking for upvotes is against Reddit site-wide rules.
This happens even when I haven’t hit the build limit too lol
Abusing bugs is against epic's TOS, don't use it guys it's lame.
No ,after last update i dont want to Play STW ,BR ... anymore . If they wont change this crap i will give away all my RSS i think and delete the game . 
It only sux now. Played one Frostnite and a few venture missions before this chit update . 
Glad i never was hyped for cosmetics and didnt waste that much money  into this game .

The only good thing from this Season is the new Theme Music ! 🤠🎸

I mean, there's potential if you're team is coming onto site at the same time. Either you die and get traded (since their back is turned to your teammates) or you trade your teammates. 

Generally not the best move tho, usually you're only good for one. Pretty great when there's a lone op tho, very little they can do lmao.
Everytime there's a bot/thrower in the other team I always try to make it fair but then my team says I'm throwing 🥲
You might have 7 brain cells ngl
is the Reaver set limited edition?
Thanks I think I’ll try some brimstone lineups then
defenders already use hero xp so i think defenders using hero superchargers would work fine
Oh nice!! Then i got them! Thank you for the info!
Stop equating the neopronouns nonsense with trans people, you're doing more to galvanize bigots in this thread than anyone else I have seen in recent times.

To alot of folks, yes.
Ah the power of the inspection feature.
Besides maybe memeing, not really
OBS might let you stream to multiple sources

Yes. But it doesn't effect angle change in 3D space. One degree is the same one degree no matter what resolution.
Besides his mediocre gameplay, he would've had proof and he would've shown it in light of all this drama. Besides, he's obviously somebody with a pretty big ego and already got exposed for lying about his rank. Why would you believe somebody like that when they say they got Radiant but can't prove it at all?

I love Perry2N but he's a unique case
i had the same rpoblem before a few times actually, look at my comment
Might need to figure out a good set of perks depending on the weapon and what kind of weapons you use. As some are better with a type of weapon for certain situations. Like, don't use a slow firing pistol when against a hoard of husk unless it is a perk that causes an explosion that can take out a bunch in a small area, or can hit multiple enemies at once.
I literally haven't done one since they removed them from the Vbuck mission pool. No reason to do them anymore.
just use those materials to build out your next base.  you'll need more and more as you progress
lol i’m in the same era as you- 6 digit steam id, made cal im playoff finals once
My friends say I'm uncoachable 😭
To further clarify: it doesn’t happen every single time, but fairly frequently.

I still phase shift like always, but while doing so my weapon switches… I’m running around with my baron, phase shift, and at the end of the phase shift I will have my second weapon in hand instead of the baron, causing me to constantly have to switch back to the baron. Very, very annoying 
thank you fwend! I find the intersections between "actual gender" and "perceived gender" and toxicity is a pretty interesting point to think about when it comes to your research. I'd love to elaborate more if you'd like instead of dumping it on you all at once! :D
Shirorz he’s hit radiant multiple times with neon and hes the best tactical neon main in the game. He also understand how to use each of neons abilities intricately and he doesnt just movement all of his enemies because that is just throwing.
Maybe get a duo?

I think omen has the possibility to be both a normal assisting controller with his blind and entry with Jett by tping in her smoke and be a good lurk with your ability to smoke off trips or tp past them. Plus his smokes are great for one ways and his ability to hold high low plus his long blind make him great for both defense and offense
I have my tracker on and check out the enemies' ranks during the buy round. Funny seeing a Bronze 1 with insane stats queued with Golds and Plats. Really can't do anything about it so we just double or triple peek the smurf or make sure they die first.
Kj have unlimited range in the utilities
In my opinion, you should change your understanding. adjust yourself to sens and DPI.
so play more and try to get used to it.（；＿；）
Lmao, you didn't have to use logic on them like that.
No one can ever complain about being unlucky again. This guy is king of the unlucky
Can I has?
Hard disagree. Iso was never picked and seen as a throw. His ult being is saving grace.

Comtrary to the hundreds of posts dunking on him I like the new Iso. He fills a completely new niche and he can finally call himself the 1v1 guy.

clean shots and good thought process. One tip would be to seek cover before committing to util, that way you wont rubberband btwn decisions to minimize downtime.
You’re looking for r/fortnitebr. This is the Save the World subreddit.
Gold is absolutely the limit of a lot of people, comments here are clueless 😂everyone’s perspectives on rank and skill are skewed by their own levels and streamers. 

Most people will never rise above silver or gold, that’s the point of a ranking system and how distribution works.

To me gold 3 is very respectable, that’s top 42% of players. Better than the majority. And you’re having fun, that’s the most important part
Fracture icebox is ok
Love it at lvl 1 but grown to hate the shooting noise. Feels very unsatisfying compared to others
How did you go in first person?
i dont, but im working on it. i will say though, two days before the reset i had a six game losing streak that probably dragged my mmr down quite a bit, i didnt think itd be that bad though
Whenever I play omen during the first few rounds I would fake TP just to condition them into thinking I’m playing off angles works most of the times
In higher Elo against multiple Enemies you’re just dead as soon as you want to crouch because you’re a sitting duck and everybody is shooting you. You can’t keep moving and strafeshoot with an Odin like you can with a Vandal
I’ve been exclusively playing palworld recently
Yeah it wasn't aimed at the elo thing but it was aimed at the floor getting very high, so that currently a beginner guitarist is nowhere near an actual newbie
He is called iso because it’s the Greek prefix for „equal“ and he equalizes the chances before his gunfights with his ult and bubbles.
Thats literally what flanking means even if ur lurking u can still look at map and use smoke to help them while u flank thats the good part about controllers
Maybe the random lowered the average skill level of the team? Try kicking them and inviting your friend

Most people hate it because you have to comm on this map or you're lost.
Lmao you’re definitely low elo. His strength only helps in specific situations, so just don’t play into it, any high elo player will know how to adapt. Don’t dry peak don’t hold angles that give a shielded iso the advantage. Use util, there’s so many ways to break his shield lol, sova dart raze nade mollies Skye dog…….. even a simple pop flash double peek gets the job done. You’re looking at things so linearly I’d be surprised if you’re ascendant and above, maybe not since there’s so many boosted people these days….
Lol people just don't get it. Like, why not ask for a gun? It's literally free money. And if you suck at aiming, who cares? We all have our off days. Just do the math and realize that we're loaded with cash and can spare a rifle or two. Don't be a hero with your half-shielded spectre, it ain't gonna impress anyone. Trust me, I've been there before too. So next time, just swallow your pride and ask for that sweet AK-47 or whatever fancy gun you want. No need to pretend like you're doing us a favor by not asking for one.
What op described in this post isn’t sexual harassment let’s be real, and regardless I never do any of the things they described. 

But when I get any of the countless types of toxicity/abuse (including what op talked about) I know how to deal with it in a way such that my day doesn’t get ruined because of some strangers on the internet. In fact I usually am the one who ruins their day. 


And the important thing is that, it’s not just me. I saw a lot, a lot of abuse towards male players, as well as female. The abuse towards males is naturally bigger cause their numbers are bigger.


In either case, they know how to deal with it. It’s literally a skill in online team based games. If you let such things affect your performance (not just in that particular game, but the whole day) then you’re sabotaging yourself. And you will feel discouraged about playing the game more.
I love to play smokes but its incredibly frustrating when your team doesn't listen and is hellbent on going A fifteen times in a row and getting dicked on.
No
Global Util. (AKA unlimited range for her smokes + she can use her abilities from anywhere on the map, meaning she can literally stall a push on A while being on B)

She also excels in applying pressure all across the map, as she can place her stars on any given area without necessarily fully commiting to smoking it, making your gameplan for the round less telegraphed compared to other controllers.
At \*very\* low level/skill, like below 50 hours played, yes given that it directly relates to improvements.

After level 20-40 (around the level you unlock the ranked mode), the correlation starts to fade away for sure.

Another thing that greatly reduce correlation is previous FPS experience, a seasoned CSGO player will be better even with a lower valorant level.

I know lot of level 100 Immo and level 300 silvers/bronze.
I wouldnt say its awful its really not that bad
See this is what im talking about.
This just isn’t true lol, she has no good tools to set herself up, and 90% of the time a good Reyna is dismissing not healing.

This clip is so random, the movement the bait the peeks everything is so uncoordinated 😭 shot on Viper was nice all the rest are good but normal. Gold/Plat maybe?
Thank you!
woohojin pointed it out once, a lot of pros hold(especially close range), the example he showed was demon1(which has some crazy knives), because when you watch him when he 1 taps someone he usually throws another knife by accident and he ends up playing with 4 knives a lot of times


you can see it in this clips, I even looked at more streamers that are not demon1 and you can also see that:

I figured out a fix:   

1. Open the riot client    

2. Click on Valorant   

3. Click on the User Profile    

4. Go to settings   

5. Change the game text language to anything else besides English   

6. Start Valorant    

7. Exit Valorant and change the Text Language back to English and start Valorant again   


This worked for me

skill issue tbh. Also enable the shooting error graph in settings, if its blue, you are moveing
Kinda need to see when you get the kills that you do get per round, -but- it looks like you're comfortable with the duelist role, so I wouldn't necessarily change it. Maybe mix in some initiators if your teammates insta-lock duelists.

You'd probably do pretty good as an entry-frag / second-entry type of role, creating space for your team and making sure that post plants on Attack go smoothly, and first frags on defense as well.

Only thing I'd say is to try and work on is your headshot %. You're clearly good enough for Diamond if not Ascendant, but I think the average Diamond player has a headshot % of like, 25 or higher, so just something like that might also prove to be fruitful for you, esp. if you're entrying or playing first contact on Defense.

Other than that, though, I think just stay the course of what you're doing, cause clearly it's working at least on a performance-front.

Gekko's molly was that size from the start.
His entire kit is smokes and walls, he is not someone you should play if you aren't playing with a organized team, the sheer amount of walls he can put down is what makes him good. Good enough to see much pro play. He fills a similar niche to Astra who also has tons of smokes.
This doesn't explain how the cube queen's zombies look different in BR
Tbf, they’ve placed top 3 the past few internationals and it’s hard to be that good consistently. I wouldn’t be surprised if they do worse for a period before it gets better (if they do). A team getting Top 3 consistently imo means you can still take it on any given day, but PRX probably has a mental block now, especially with their playstyle it can be hard to get over the top. If nothing else, they’re still exciting
If it might help, I was Plat in Overwatch and reached Diamond only after buying a 144hz monitor

Hold the mouse like an egg. Your aim will worsen at first but it’ll get better and more calm this way. Super light grip, but fast motion is ok. Be calm and patient when shooting (gunfights last way longer than you think, so no need to be super flicky)

also as a shaky aimer (but not diagnosed hand tremors) mine is .1 1600 and it works well. Only issue is too much aim training will make your forearm hurt (esp after a gym session) so stretch before and after. This feeling will be reduced with the above advice of holding the mouse super softly and calmly.

Looks amazing so far!

One question: how did you make this? At first I thought it was 3d printed but then I saw the screws so I'm not sure
You don’t earn your rank playing against gold against *other* previous ascendants. Anyone who waits a month to play will rank up fast because people will climb back to their ranks. But right now you only play against people who were previously the same rank as you, just on a lower rank

Really? I just play, and enjoy the game. Y'all really taking entertainment seriously.
I hope a girl becomes the undisputed best player at some point so people will stop acting like gender matters.
First move is to step away from duelist. Leave this to the youths with sub 100ms reaction time. 

Crosshair placement is going to be your best friend so learn it well. You're not going to be able to pull off those nasty flicks that can sometimes save you if you're aiming at the wrong spot. You wait for their head to come to your crosshair and shoot. 

Learn some fancy lineups. This requires no reaction time at all and I've seen some bad brimstone players on youtube get to a respectable rank because they know 3 lineups for every default plant.

You tried taking some caffeine before games? It usually halves my reaction time especially when I'm sleep deprived.

And just play as your usually do.  


At least in my perspective, I don't at deaths, assists much until the end of the game.  
... Unless I wanna go after their carry if I could lol.  


It is also best to check your mindset. I am just assuming you know. If you don't know, you can search it up and it may help you get there.  


Most important of all, try to relax as you play. It may help. Act as if you are playing casually. Having fun will help you improve in the game.
Voice commands + mouse, at least. Click baiting there aren't ya?
Yupp definitely Prosperity and Demise knife. I hardly ever use it.
Or Apex if you want a bit more tac to your shooter
Hello!
It's based on stats that you can look up on tracker and blitz. Cypher was buffed wdym? Viper was nerfed. Some duelist got buffed others were nerfed.
I know what you meant, but the distinction literally doesn't matter. My point is that it is completely reasonable to say this screaming lunatic is more annoying than some farmer activating survivors.
crit + double pump. You're welcome

Absolutely, I'd have extras
Oni. This may be an actually unpopular opinion, but to me they feel so basic and all of the different oni guns look the same
It wont give you what you would get by searching
They can't blame their slow internet speed or slow hand movement. They need someone to blame.
The human being is not a consistent machine. Some days your body and mind will be more or less tuned in. Adapt mentally and game play wise. If you're used to entry fragging, hold corners more if your not in the zone.
Well, you are at the end of ventures, right?
How much did he offer?
If you really do want to improve I’d strongly suggest getting a coach. Even a $10-20 one on Metafy with good enough reviews can help you a lot. Vod reviewing yourself is not really helpful if you don’t know what you’re looking for. But even a casual Immortal player can point out the flaws in a Gold player pretty easily and it goes a long way in helping you improve.

I like to believe I'm an evolved human with psychic abilities.

I will use my abilities to "guess" one these neanderthals was a Reyna.
Brim isn’t the best smoker on any map. So how the fuck is he the best on every map? What a low elo opinion
Still playing on my Xbox One and never had a issue with Dungeons lol
While it would be cool to get new quest lines to explain the new zone, I wouldn’t get my hopes up. There was nothing in the files that indicated there would be any and I doubt they would keep the new quests a secret
They just need to lower the shield up time by a lot and I think he’ll be fine. He’s very overtuned right now, no too early about it lol
Play selfishly. Especially in lower elo games, tell your team when you're flashing, faulting, etc. but ultimately adapt a 1v5 mentality when Solo Queueing. 

Because if your team doesn't capitalize on your abilities (which they wont) they are wasted. Playing off your own abilities is slightly different than using them for other players to play off so keep that in mind. 

Until you have players coordinating with you, you'll have to change your default setups to be able to take advantage of Breach's kit. 

On offense I play quite aggro with him and on defense I like to sit back site and time unloading your util to halt the progress of the attackers.
Does it happen to be grandmascervix?
What's your edpi?

Edpi is your sens x dpi. Generally speaking, you want your edpi to be 280-408.

Any lower and it'll feel muddy and slow, while any higher it'll be too slippery and you'll have a hard time controlling it.

Man's actually losing it
Its mostly the bottom fraggers that choose to draw. I once drew a 16-16 match (my first and only time drawing) because i was 10-29. If we were to win I would've gained +10rr max but if lose oh my god, minimum -25rr. It's a better choice at the moment to get away with 0rr.

Selfish move? Absolutely.

Fix the anti air traps. They're not working against flingers.
I've run out of ammo maybe a handful of times.  If you are relying on 100-120 bullets each round which is only 1:40, you are playing poorly.
There's not much of a waitline, however he does have a list of pre-coaching requirements that you need to meet before he'll review a VOD (i.e. play consistently, have at least 300 hours of ranked playtime, attempt to communicate/IGL with teammates, aim train regularly, ETC.) The intent of this is to help you improve by yourself in every aspect that you're able to, so that when you submit a VOD to him, all he has to help you with is the more complex issues.

Dopai and OD26 used to do free vod reviews, but I'm not sure if either still does (last I checked, OD has primarily moved to paid coaching, and Dopai is focusing on the ranked climb. Dopai might still do coaching too, but I'm not certain). 

There are some other paid options like Maxie (formerly SoaR Maxie) and Konpeki, but I haven't seen enough of their private coaching to rate them.

And ofc assuming he's still free, you could try JollzTV, but his "coaching" isn't terribly helpful, and he's more focused on content than actually helping people improve. 

TL;DR Woohoojin has a somewhat long list of requirements before you can be coached, but overall he's probably your best option for entirely free vod reviews.



(Also sorry for writing a literal novel in response to your question, I've just spent WAY too much time watching coaching content and I'd like to pass on this info to others.) :D
you got any spares 🙏
My reaction after my teammate says the last guy is cracked but instead I get jumped by 3 guys and a raptor
When you are in your knife skin select, you can click on the upgrade level to specifically equip that level.
womp womp
Why do you take it that way, literally the headline and description makes reference to the fact that it is not the first time and it is already being too regular this behavior, the discussion is to know if it is really a problem that is escalating?
1. The modifiers aren’t random. They happen at the same wave every time.

2. There’s currently a bug where durability bonuses for traps aren’t applied so your traps might have lower durability than normal. You can easily check this by walking up to a trap and looking at it
A shit one
Plus. Play the Battlepass and you get it back. And they don't suck either.

It's not like you have the defaults, with a bit of color change and that's your Battlepass. You have dances, meeles, free variations, sprays, backblings and of course the V-Bucks (which I think is 1100 instead of 950 or 1000, so if you save enough, you can buy stuff from the shop)

Heck, you can get the Battlepass all for free. You get 300 from a single Battlepass with free tier, that will mean 3 and a half of a Battlepass to get the premium one. And after that, you will always have it free.

Or if you play Rocket League, just join Fortnite Crew and you get Battlepasses for both games for 12€
I still main viper on breeze. I just physically hate what they did to the map. Mid halls is useless, and they added a bunch of crates/boxes so you can fight close angles. I feel like the breeze before was a more wide area and most of your fights were long open wide peeks. I can say that I do like ulting on B site more now because you can catch the back site and play off the boxes and have better wall peeks.
Yeah see that's what they all say but I'm ranking DOWN, not even up or staying the same rank.

Being good with an op takes more skill than you would think
yeah ppl love to argue here
Thanks for pointing this out! 

In the game I was referring to, I was playing skye and my buddy omen. I consistently made first contact on site, with our Reyna either lurking mid and dying when they rotated or being the last to push onto site.
Skins for any game ever should not exceed $5. $5 is already insanely overpriced. $2 skins should be normal. 

But greedy capitalist companies gonna be greedy and all it takes is a few whales for them to consider their ridiculous thievery prices worth it.

Hmm I have Jonesy as lead. I felt it's was relaxing to have the mini gun run for a long time. But now that I think about it it would be better with Spitfire because then you can abort when needed and start again really fast. Thanks!
Yes you said you can Headshot 23 bot (assume in training) so which level bot are they
I have 60% winrate and I still thinm Breeze is dogshit.

Her entire thing is giving life why would slow orb decay
Competitive games aren't always fun because they're so difficult . But Riot have optimized their matchmaking to keep you chasing the high of a "good" game... Whether that's dropping a 30 bomb MVP or winning a triple overtime after losing the first have 3-9.
like.. incognito mode for valorant?
No, not really.

You can camp in smokes, but that doesn't chamge the fact that you still can get one tapped.

Just learn to play better guns
i only call out cheating when someone is playing suspiciously, im not venting frustration, im calling out odd behavior

it could be the setting "limit fps on battery"
yeah me too. dinked is just easier to say and what my teammates learn is about the same anyway. i only ever used gooshed if it was immediately necessary like “oh that guys gooshed, toss a frag”. or if a no armor call would be helpful, like if someone is running a scout/marshal depending on the game
Least crazy GC drama
>Founders will be earning vbucks at the same rate. 

Yes but no...

Because you reset everyone to day zero. And from that you are able to earn the same amount of vbucks after the same amount of days.

Of course you will have to spend more time with playing the game now (which I don't see as a problem BUT I do understand that those who just logged in will have a problem now).

And those of us who are 3-4 days away of their 800 or 1000 Vbucks won't be earning those at the same rate... we won't get it and that's bs.
Wrong sub. You want either r/fortnitecreative or r/FortniteBR
Yep that’s the problem, you are unable to play stw on switch for some dumb reason
wait really? I've dropped league for like 3 years and never heard anything about it

i just control the spray
Okay knew i should just stop playing you gave me the confirmation :(
I sort of agree?

Sunset is fine. But I remember the hatred for Lotus was **insane** when it first came out.

I'll admit, I hated it too. But it was mostly because the game was forcing me to learn a new arena and it kept feeling like I was dying because I didn't know which corners were the most important
1. That's basically how it works already. Other than the fact that the 'skip queue' button is Alt + F4, all you get the first few times is a warning. 

2. I'm down for random agent in casual gamemodes, absolutely not in comp tho.
Be able to pop instant slide instead of waiting for sprint to charge (we dont count Neon ult) and make it go a bit further
True, but understand that not all cheaters are going to want to drop 30-40 bombs every game. It will be too obvious. Sometimes players will have 2-3 (sometimes usually 2 max) partied up turning cheats on and off amongst each other to balance the game and not trigger vanguard. They do it just enough to win their games. Sometimes they may have a negative player who is most likely playing terrible and is a fall guy while calling plays using wall cheats. I dont understand why people think you need to have blatant cheats to be cheating, or that you need to drop 100-5 in scoreboard to be a cheater. In my entire val gaming, ive experienced 1 spinbot cheater, and that person was banned a little after, but he was able to play full game and win. The issue is hardware cheats have become insanely difficult to detect and tell the difference between legit plays and cheats
Yoru clone probs as well these days heh
https://www.diskanalyzer.com
She’s low if the person I’m spectating needs a quick call out. And if no1 is fighting, it’s agent hit xx number
But then they always claim MMR is fake and it's perfectly okay for them, obviously a plat player, to be in a lobby, obviously an iron player.
So this could be several issues. Like for some odd reason you client is not pulling the files correctly. However you may not find the help you need here as this sub reddit is meant for Save the World. Help for creative/creator islands is probably best found at r/FortniteCreative. I hope you can find the help you need.
lel.....well shit.
Bro, Chill. Iso and these other agents may not be the best, but at least they're giving us something new to play with. Don't knock it till you try it.
Literally unplayable
I feel like mephistopheles was harder than MSK, but tbh i struggled with cryptid boss fight back when it came out and nobody had director's cut 😂

These have been bugs for a long time but don't worry, I'm sure epic is rushing to fix it. Especially now that they're trying to make us play the game even more by changing daily login to mission rewards

But once this happened to me and I found the Med Bot in the middle of a lake in the centre of the map. They basically just show up somewhere random if at all
All the videos out there showing sick plays by Neon mains like ShiroRz utilise some form of crazy movement in one way or another, but I don't know if it's because I'm playing against people who don't aim for the head but just spray and pray, I always get sprayed down trying to do that  
  
So I started playing Neon like a Reyna, focusing on my gunplay primarily, and my abilities second. I don't know if I've ever seen another Neon player walk while in her ultimate, or walk-slide around an angle lmao  
  
Things I've learnt about her abilities you might find useful:  
  
1) No matter how high up her stun hits against a wall, the AOE will still be on the ground. You can see in the clip that I shot my first stun up high on the right of the arch. That way I could still possibly stun Jett without overexposing myself to aim for the ground  
  
2) You get 1 slide per round, and it recharges for every 2 kills you get. However, once you enter your ultimate, you get another slide for free. So you can use it to your advantage by sliding, popping your ultimate, then sliding again, as seen in the clip against Jett  
  
3) After you enter your sprint mode, there's a short maybe 0.5 second delay, after which you can do an instant slide. You don't always need to run/build up momentum before you slide. In a way it's like a walk/one-step slide that allows you to wide peek an angle, as seen in the clip (vs Jett and Iso and Cypher), similar to Raze's satchel peek  
  
4) In contrast to the usual short delay before you can pull out your gun and start firing after you slide, her ultimate allows you to start shooting and continue shooting her lightning even while sliding, as seen in the clip (vs Jett and Iso)  
  
Also sadly if you get 5 kills but one's a double-kill on a revive (by Sage) it's not considered an Ace :(
hiiiii
thanks for understanding ☺️☺️ 

I would love to play with you but im gonna go on a limb and say we're probably nowhere near in the same servers

are u on asia by any chance???
It seems like the heal itself is the glitch. You didn't actually get healed to 150 serverside even though the client says you did (miscommunication/glitch between the two) and therefore 139 damage was enough to kill you. 

Either way, not a mechanic lol.
Valorant's anti cheat is so good that there is 99% chance the player hitting those headshots is not cheating. I've been playing this game for years and encoutered literally only one person who got instantly banned
I think he's describing it more like sending a yoru decoy with the wall, it could be you or it might not be
Got the same when I unconsciously aim lazy

For me this means that I for whatever reasons don't pay much attention to micro adjustments, so either my crosshair is on point from the get go, but if it's off by a small amount I start hitting like a stormtrooper
If I had to throw out a guess, I would say that your raw mouse control is great, but you have zero target confirmation.

I've heard that before about the gap between immortal 1 and radiant being bigger than iron and immortal, and it blows my mind. Does it mean the road is longer or the skill difference? I can elaborate if that doesn't make sense
Nah, he’s aware. He is stepping in the right direction. Just a little more time and effort, he will be able to manage. Making a post is actually a healthy sign in my eyes. You know when they say “can’t change a person unless they want to change”.

Brim has other utility as well.
Currently, if Astra invests 4 stars into smokes as per your comparison, then that uses up her impact as an Agent.
But when brim does it he still has 550 value worth of utility to work with.

I was not goofing off. I should have made it clear in my original post but the Reyna on my team was being very rude to the opposing team and to calm him down I told him to just have fun and enjoy the game. Note- we were winning and we won the match as said in the post. Please remember that val is a game and you’re not being paid to play it, you should have fun :) if you’re that serious you should join an actual team and go to tournaments

Most of the people here have probably played CoD and Halo at some point. You're not special, you're just trying to defend kids being dickwads.
Its hard to say. The guide contents dont show much proof that this method is the way to go. Could work but who knows. 

I would read this guide, and many other guides and try following them. Then come up with your own opinion and what you think is optimal. You might end up just taking what works from each guide and disregard the rest. 

Ive heard other advice from immo+ players that say the opposite of this person where they say people over emphasise on mechanics and game sense is just as important (eg mechanics wont save you from being shot in the back, ending up in unfavoured retakes, getting util spammed) etc

Its confusing i know.
Thanks for providing the platform you're on and how you connect to the internet...very helpful
One of my duos was hard stuck gold1.

They bought a plat 3 account for giggles to see if they can hang.

The flew up to ascendant in a couple of weeks. Still has a 1.2 kd in ascendant 

When you duo queue with them on their gold account, the quality of the opponent is something else. If you queue with other gold 1s the quality is normal.

It’s crazy cause I was always a denier of “my account is cursed”…. I made fun of those people.

Now I’ve lost all faith in the match maker.
I have a separate pair of glasses that aren't as strong that I use when I'm on the computer
Learn all the characters then pick one from each role to main.
I do see the similarities lol
Ikr?
People mostly had no problem paying for his lessons and were usually positive on his tutorials before they knew about the Radiant issue.
Okay...thanks for telling,ill check them out.
> seemed serious

he is a good actor
Fr why didn't I think about being optimal earlier and hitting every shot with no error smh. Now that I know that I should've just been optimal ima go peak 1300rr radiant
I got Crosscose for $5 recently. The whole ass game. 

It's baffling to see what people will argue cosmetic prices should cost.
“Put more work into it” is pretty subjective. A clean skin with good animations takes as much work to design and create as one that’s busier/has more “intricate” styling, like the reaver. It’s minimalist and clean, and the design flows well. Is it less wild than other vandals? Yes, but that doesn’t mean they’re low effort or that they didn’t put as much work into them.

Aye man this act I dropped from Diamond 1 to Gold 3 in like two weeks and climbed back up. Shit just happens. Those are the same two roles I play and yes it does get frustrating when yu feel like yu dont have impact, but yu can win plenty of games just by doing your job and giving good comms every game. Yes yu should be aim training if yu want to get better but also watching other pros, val guides on different maps helps. Only play with a positive and ready to win mindset. Never tilt queue and play when yu are losing. Just have to take breaks when it can be helped and take it day by day.

Thanks for the help :)
lol I play premade 5 only and sometimes players are having a good day. It doesn’t mean they are smurf
PC must be a lot better because ain’t no French people speaking English on the London server
Riot themselves thought Raze needed a change, this isn't the opinion of some newcomer, the company themselves changed Raze bc they thought her grenade and satchel were too good.
Is this a bug? 

Yesterday/Today I played multiple games and got kicked out of some of those games, then when i tried to log in again I had to do an upgrade and had to restart the computer bc it said vanguard wasn't on. This happened to multiple people - adding up in one game to a total of 7 of us having this issue. 
And no matter how many times it happened the upgrade that had to be made was always the same size and took around the same time too.
Do you happen to dodge any of your games at any time? Or unintentionally AFK for an extended amount of time one of your games? There are RR reductions/deductions in particular situations (AFK, etc) for you if you do those things.
Thats really interesting and good info i'm gonna try practicing it! Thanks
Might be true but again its not about the build its about the action… and also i do pyramids around atlas in 160s all the time… it just works… back in the day there was even a jail in a rtd where husks and smashers just walked into using the ramps…

Fresh game, less throwers, hackers,…. Racists. And the competitive matchmaking is just overall better if you’re wanting to play a game competitively, csgo nowadays it’s really hard to get a team that communicates or doesn’t throw or cheats, don’t get me wrong, there’s still a lot of throwing and no comms in Valorant but it’s a lot less likely
If you want to learn Omen, I really reccomend watching Flexinja, he's one of the reasons I picked up Omen. 

His YT:https://youtube.com/@flexinja?si=6-_pTtgoL0IvZD70

Hope this helps!
I main fade and I feel that even when I play breach or skye.

I'm always stuck in positions where I'm not in an ideal position to kill or get killed mid drone/dog.

Though they have flashes, they are fundamentally slower than a phoenix or reyna flash which can play off themselves much quicker.

When I am left in a 1 v 5 scenario as fade it is incredibly difficult to use an info gathering agent when I already know 5 of them are going to just run me down.
need one for xbox 🫶🏻
You are contributing to the mission right? You need to actually earn the alert for it to count
Isnt he doing the overflick-deadzone routine here? I dont expect a gold player to do good on hard for that routine
I dont believe so
If you haven't played for a year there is probably 2 new maps for you to learn, which is Lotus and Sunset. I am also a diamond player so this is my TLDR opinion on the maps:

Lotus : A map with 3 sites with a new type of rotating door that can be accessed by both sides of the door. This map usually plays out with heavy contest on A, the B site usually where the sentinel play their utilities and the C site usually have someone on the defense peak from the barrier.   
Sunset : A 2 sites map which in my opinion the is quite like ascent in a way a mid control is usually contested. If mid control is not taken usually the attacking team is just gonna rush and dump utilities till they can take the site.

As for agents, you have Gekko, Deadlock and Iso. Deadlock and Iso is not meta so u can just ignore them, Gekko is stronger but not meta yet. Gekko have a "summon" that can plant bomb that can you shoot and also a flash that you need to shoot (just like Reyna flash). Right now the strongest agent is probably Cypher with its trip have a reactivation mechanic so you need to destroy the trip if you don't wanna get caught again.
well ive tried that and it shows a tab opening but it just closes like half a secong later ive tried deleting fortnite and reinstalling it but nothing seems to work ive been trying for days but nothings working and when i try toput "install prod-fn" it says something like not correct or something stupid like that I NEED ANSWERS

Ok but like what if I reach the build limit 🙁
party royale moment.
All duellists are now useless
It's like some of you mfer want power creep
If you add a double space at the end of a paragraph like this[space][space]     
It will show up like this. Alternatively you can do double enter/return like this[enter]     
[enter]

It will show up like this.
My general experience as a 25 y/o has been:

Iron - Silver: a mix of little kids and adults who are chill and don’t take the game super seriously, if anything are more likely to get frustrated with you if you’re a giga tryhard even though it’s comp.

Gold - Diamond: A bunch of teenagers and squeakers with high egos and no social skills who are cracked out on g fuel.

Asc - Immortal: Some people with high egos but a majority of people are chill and have a mutual understanding that everyone here is pretty good at the game. Back to a lot of people who are like college/young adult age (anecdotal evidence, this is where most of my friends who are my age that aren’t in iron-silver reside) who are nice but will get frustrated if you do enough objectively dumb stuff.

Radiant: Haven’t been there to experience it but considering a large chunk of this is pro players who have to be 18+ in order to play on an international stage, willing to bet this is mostly adults.
My ping is always 20-30 and I just had a situation yesterday where I melted someone with a Spectre but turns out they only took 30 damage. 

The game made it look and sound like all my shots had connected, but I can slowly replay the scene of the enemy Clove turning towards me and popping me after spraying them down. 

Kyedae has a few shorts on her YouTube showing this in past episodes so it might be a bug that has been around for a long time. Not sure how it is triggered. 
id still rather have a sage on my team than a deadlock
It could be your practice routine. If you’re doing it before comp, you might be using all your endurance. (It’s also best to do a routine like that right before bed)
They could have the Standard Edition. Those don't have the Founders icon
araxys is great but not as a vandal imo
I mean tbf you were losing anyways. You lose an extra bit of rr but it's not gonna make or break anything
Probably sick of toxic players mocking or ignoring them. Does my head in, a player will have 6k in the bank after his full load out and not buy because I'm having a bad game. And yet if I can afford a rifle after my buy out I will always offer. I will tell players I'll buy for them so they can get full shields ect
To be honest my first fighting game was SF5 and I got destroyed every game for weeks until I learned how to actually play. Valorant is just so punishing when you can die so fast, also when for some reason there's a smurf Reyna in every match
Ranked makes you be level 20 before you can play ranked and that is a long time to know what characters abilities are. So I don’t think your being honest here or your friend isn’t
Ah yess
That’s why I just do RTD and repair the shelters in the 160s. I need minimal assistance for the repair and you learn quick if anyones gonna help in the RTD. I’ll leave if they appear useless
I would just recommend you woohojin like everyone else. Here's the link to his videos.

We will say it again from the beginning too. You're in the wrong subreddit. This subreddit only applies to the PvE Save the World mode of Fortnite. You can go to r/fortnitebr but you will not get a better reception there, nobody is going to buy or trade you a skin. I'm pretty sure it is against the rules. Give up.
Not even in-game, that's crazy
Yes
Am I the only one that get players that don’t talk at all?
‘Raze or troll’
They do just only 4 times a year, they'll ignore a lot but this is one of the few blatant things that they won't let slip through
Impact kills are kills that give you a numbers advantage. 

Getting a kill when numbers are even is huge because you just made it much more statistically likely your team will win that round. 

But if you bait your team and they all die, it doesn’t matter if you get 2-4 frags because more than likely you’re still gonna lose the round and those kills are meaningless.

Basically trade your teammates, don’t overheat, and only play aggressive if your down in numbers to try and even out the round again.
Do y’all use it along with plasmatic discharger?
[removed]
I main smoke agents and double smoke comp is rare in low elo. I can already see the double smoke comps will become more and more common with this agent. Because in the right hands, she has the potential to be lethal and not just your typical smoke support.
Yes, Woohoojin's coaching is free! Yes, he is a Radiant-tier coach.

Woohoojin's coaching is unique, and you should strive to learn from him.
But wouldn’t certain ways produce better results and accuracy?
I don't think so but it might be because it needs to be a modified roof ramp thing instead of a ramp ramp
Shes weak as a controller the win rate means nothing cus it's s team game
Main Jett and yell inspiring shit on comms. Raises team morale and helped me escape in 20 smth hours
Kj has 63%.
Sage reyna pheonix neon yoru gecko has essentially 0% pick rate.
That doesnt mean these agents are useless and Viper is OP.

Viper is easy to coordinate strats with. Especially in the current double smoke meta. If you use two of your five agent spots for controllers, you ought to get some value out of it. Standalone viper is not busted by any means. It’s the strats that are good.
Yep

Hell Rippley is literally his model but slurp
Because that’s how you improve IMO learning fundamentals by playing with and against players who are fundamentally better than me has always lead to improvement for me at least. But also I play multiplayer games to have fun with friends I don’t enjoy playing with randoms where its a dice roll anyways.
I haven’t played in a couple months because I’m sick of playing the same 7 maps over and over. Remove the map pool for everything except pro play.
Because there's a social factor that is causing there to be significantly less highly skilled women players
There isn't a blatant spinbotter or cheating Russian in every single lobby.
It’s ranked bro, you don’t need to cook up strats every round and have a double init/controller setup to deny/gain map control
Thank you for this!
Anyone else what?
10 games really is not that much. I don't play that much personally but it's only like 5 hours on average, you can easily do that even with a full time job lol. not to mention the majority of people playing valorant are teens/young adults and likely don't have major responsibilities like a full time job/family/etc. no need to shame the guy on how they spend their free time.
comp and swift. swift mainly when i dont want to sewat, although some swift matche are very sweaty too on occasion.
Teammates that scream at me to heal them. First, I'm halfway across the map, second, do you think you're gonna get what you want with that tone? No more healing for you.
Reyna: Instalock and bottom frag

Iso: I feel like throwing today

Brim: Lineup Larry

Jett: Lurking

Raze: "Im gonna double satchel and rocket on entry" \*dies before rocket pops\*
I can't worry about cheaters and smurfs when 90% of my games have my teammates trying to FF after 2 deaths or just straight running it down
Jail.
Lmao at people say not cheating. I’ve played in a few Radiant lobbies and this is subtle but 100% cheating. If you zoom in on the Jett kill you can literally see it lock and move unnaturally smooth. It’s robotic and you can see it track. Same thing with Neon, the tracking is very inhuman. Also the not even reacting even a tiny bit to the Skye flash potentially coming is fucking weird.
20 games :)
The toxic level is huge oh yeeees. 
Yesterday i got lvl 20 and tried my first rated Game.
The Game started and after 3 rounds i was 1:3 kd.
And then it started, a super agressive guy started yelling to me " youre useless, get the fck out " " delete the game " 
and so on... extremly demotivated situation
It's over for us Party Royale players
Oh no. How will we ever live?
Dpi is your mouse’s way of measuring how far the cursor moves relative to the physical movement. Sens is the Ingame multiplier which acts of that dpi. So they multiply both of them to get eDPI, which is a much better metric.
I switched to Singapore for the time being and its far better than Mumbai's server.
If I dink someone with a phantom and end up dying, I tell myself it's a statistical anomaly and buy it again next round.
I've got playstation codes, but i'm looking for an xbox code so i can get the Riot perks on gamepass. Let me know if you want to trade links.
Around 17 for what I said plus pickaxe and back bling
Literally same for me
I think the issue is Fortnite makes fuck all money, but the other modes out this BR Season are all made by someone else (so hardly their problem besides licensing and working with another team) and also while we’ll never get every character physically, the Lego deal alone is about to become another infinite money printing machine. As far as I’m aware there’s no leaks yet besides some stuff sent to creators that had a Lego llama mini build and some teaser content for the game (and some unrelated sets that are coming to the game), but there absolutely will be physical Lego sets based on at the very least the BR mode. 

Minecraft was supposed to be a short term test, they had a couple of iterations including those micro-scale sets made of tiny plates before they settled on the current set scale with minifigures. Now there’s magazines with little kits, polybags, yearly waves of new sets, ingame content/skins based on the sets you buy (I’m aware of at least one from the Ender Dragon set). The magazines and sets often have character models based around unique skins/appearances which end up rare and sought after. You translate that into Fortnite and you’ve got a decade of infinite money with no effort on Epic’s part. 



The playercount of all the modes has completely tanked as most people just played for the quest rewards and then bounced, but they’ve already got what they wanted. We have around 30K players but with no effort to monetise Fortnite, and everyone having 5-6 figures saved up by now, it’s easier for them to just keep us on life support
Same thing with me. Every time I have a big loss streak, I expect a massive rank up the following day(s). I was D3 deranked down to G2 after tilt queueing, hit A2 the following week. When I hit A3, I went on to derank all the way down to D2 0 RR. The following week I hit Immortal. For some reason I'm not too worried about big red streaks, considering they're always followed by big green ones.
You were probably super charged, or they gave you more as reward for not giving the rewards if other missions
As a Deadlock main, there are more useful agents. I will say she seems to really be good on fracture, split, and abyss.

r/VALORANT will be [participating in a site-wide protest](https://old.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/142qffd/rvalorant_will_disable_all_posting_and_comments/) on June 12th against reddit's proposed new changes that would result in the removal of all third-party reddit clients. Head over to the link to find out what's happening and how you can help!
Ascent - can jump on top of tiles breakable wall from bot mid
I don't think it's as cut and dry as people make it out to be - it depends on a number of things really.  


I often play smokes, so on attack I don't really mind giving the rifle to the duelist who may have forced it since I'd rather the tip of the spear have the rifle. They can take a fight, backed up by the team and they've got the best kit to help us turn 1 rifle into 2+.  


On defense, I might be tempted to keep it or give it back to the sentinel who may have forced it (rare) since I feel like that gives us good odds on defense though this depends on a number of other factors so it's not so cut and dry.  


There's also the case of psychology. Usually you can tell when being asked if your teammate will be upset if you don't give it to them. While I hate rewarding childish behavior, I am selfish in that I want to win the game so I'll happily toss them the gun if it keeps the vibes good on the team and saves me from an unnecessary game where there's an upset teammate for potentially the entire match.  


  
Also, OP - a number of people have given some funny but absolute crap advice of "politely tell them 'no' and if they resist/disagree/want the gun still then do \*insert toxic thing\*". It's very satisfying to \*write\* that, and it might be a certain level of satisfying in some cases despite costing you potential wins but you're better off going whichever route is most likely to win the game rather than trying to score points in the great never ending war against toxic players.   


Like someone else in the thread said - at increasing elo this sort of thing becomes less and less common so just focus on securing the wins and improving yourself and you will just not run into the issue.
Lucky/intuition based blind shots through smokes or walls certainly aren't the same as someone spamming a general area when suddenly the crosshair snaps perfectly 1 meter over to hit a double hs in a place where a lot of people don't even know you can wallbang. Trust me I know people get plenty of blind smoke kills, I am a brim/omen player lol. In any case that specific reyna somewhat admitted to hacking towards the end of the match, the opposing team had him sussed out as well but I admit I wrote it off as just complaining untill I actually spectated the reyna for the first time.
Haven for favourite. The perfect way to do 3-site maps. 

Split for least favourite. It used to be Fracture but over time I've developed a slight fondness for it due to using other agents I'm comfortable with rather than just trolling. Split is just a terrible map overall and playing it just makes my head hurt.
I’m in agreement with the top comment. Constructor FOR SURE. I used to main outlander or ninja five years ago because of the mobility, but after using base kyle and ice king, that’s all i use for protection missions now.
They could have left it alone, it's bad enough they refuse to give us crossplay with PC
Mute everyone as soon as you can. When was the last time you gained helpful info from chat and voice?
He is literally telling you where you have to ask. 
Ungrateful.
Val is really easy to solo carry in so the issue is definitely you. You also have to look into how much impact tjose kills have.
Harbour is meant to be played with another controller
Very productive comment!
I played a game and my team was super fun, we decided to queue up all together but one of us didnt play again and rejected our friend request but one of my teammates had a friend that he physically called so that we could queue up as 5 and not 4 it was a wholesum 4 or 5 next games we pnly played again the next day and never talked again. (Im 19 and there was a 40yo and all the others were 25 ish it was amazing)
Remember, you not always matched with a group of people with similar skill gap. Sometimes your good cuz your just better, sometimes their just better, sometimes its your lucky day and sometime it isn't so chill out.
not sure what rank you are and not sure if this is the reason your attack sucks but sometimes your team isn't on the same page as you especially if you don't let them know you're going in. if you ask for initiator util or smokes, your team will usually help you out
Id rather waste time queuing than waste time in an unwinnable game
Just use tracker. Match history n long term stats are a good thing to see. I get humbled thinking there's a smurf on the other team but there's really nothing suspicious about the account and I'm probably just having a bad day sometimes.
if you cant figure out where to throw the recon then im sorry. you should probably not be playing this game.

valorant sounds like it would be very difficult for you to get into.

best of luck tho

Nerf chamber
Unfortunately, I have done it and I have received the disgusting replies from them. They also shout at me for being illiterate lol.
someone took "his raze"

he locked neon and proceeded to:

run to the enemy with spike and die
if the spike was planted he would go run into our spawn and jump around 
ghost our position
bodyblock everyone
follow us spamming an odin behind us and at us giving away our positions once again
plant on the opposite site to us and let the enemy defuse


we lost the game hard, (one of the reasons being that my ping was constantly spiking from 50-200 making winning fights very difficult) but it still annoyed me that someone could be so childish.
the worst part?
this was on his main account. over 1k hours in this game just to still throw for such pathetic reasons like that.

She’s not in a great spot, I believe they’re reworking her. Deadlock doesn’t really play like KJ either, I’d say cypher is closer to her if you like playing off your util
If you are iron you have massive fundamental issues. Practice aiming in the training range for an hour while strafing between each kill.
What do you mean by blocked?
ah. so i was wrong. sorry for assuming i was right without researching the information first.
Was very strong on Breeze when the enemy was broke and I lost a gun the previous round. Basically an op for half price.
I haven't watched you play, but you're probably lacking some fundamental understanding of tac fps games, which will lead to your ranked matches just being "coinflips" depending on how your aim is on a given day or you being in the right place at the right time. I suggest investing in a coach or finding a high ranked player with the time to vod review your games with you
Wait no bf1, never mind, that guy might be a little strange 👀
How old are ya man? I'm pretty old. I'm talking  CS 1.3 old and I'm immo.
I’m afraid it might just be a skill issue. Check woohoojin. You might want to work on more than just aim, such as movement and crosshair placement
Yeah for sure they were rough. I progressed the “normal way” of doing all the quests before the next area, and boy were those the most draining of the bunch.
Icebox isn’t the worst map IMO. I hate Ascent far more. Ascent is the most stale shit in the game. Every map of Ascent is the exact same over and over
Valorant really fighting to get that League of Legends reputation isn’t it
KDA players.

I had someone give up on the last round of the half bc he was in a 1v3 and didn't think it was worth it. Ran and hid. Literally the worst possible option.

Go for broke. Idc if you're 15/8 or 15/9 going into the second half. I care that we're now 9-3 instead of possibly 8-4.
Good players know when to give info and when to stay quiet. Bad players will either yell or give you instructions on how to play mid clutch. Of course sometimes it’s ok to yell info depending on the situation.
wait for a good battlepass or the yourshop thing

Ok thanks
The wall has the same projectile speed and arc as a cypher cage, so lineups are limited.

You cant just chuck this thing across the map.
aim assist doesn’t stick at all it just slows your sens when you aim over an enemy, if you aren’t aiming at an enemy the shot isn’t going to bend with aim assist like a lot of games
Lies
one thing to note, when you use reyna flash put it high into the air. you’re putting it head level which makes it a lot easier for an enemy to shoot the flash and then you. putting it high in the air breaks their crosshair placement and you’ll have a much easier time that way
Im gonna report it

U just need to mentally accept that nit everything is in ur control, and some games are a wash due to bad team composition and team vibe. And readjust ur expectations and goals throughout the game. That's how I completely stopped letting this game get to me

It definately helps. However, it isn't really an instant skill upgrade, it's more just like removing the limiter. It looks way smoother, through which it's also easier on the eyes and easier to see where things are.

Going above 144hz will have deminishing returns though.
Probably good aim but not as good as abilities
Any1 got a spare Xbox code I would appreciate 😎
This works better with Yoru’s tp as the enemy team won’t hear the ultimate voice line. Honestly Fade and Yoru have the best synergy in the entire game that I’ve come across
You're getting downvoted, but it makes sense, and I've been saying this for years. "Epic can't re sell old exclusives because they'll get sued." Like yeah, sure, because who is going to sue Epic Games, a multi-billion dollar company, over a virtual cosmetic in a free to play game. They won't remove founder vbucks, but they should start to re sell old exclusives like Galaxy, Havoc, Royal Bomber, and other battlepasses in the shop. It would revitalize the game and allow us to move on from exclusivity and FOMO. It would also give Epic Games money which for some reason they appear to be low on. Best of luck to the OG development team that actually cared
i mean, she kinda is kinda easy to pick up
22 year ban? 😂 hopefully you’re still quite young
nope, go look for yourself.  there's 0 deviance on the first shot of a guardian, you're thinking of the vandal which lacks any variance on the first shot ADS and still.
Thank you man.

Or to a phone number/bank card.
its okay to disagree. but if you are going to insult me, please link your tracker
U stated it urself. He's French.
How would u play a game of guess where i am? U ult him he kills u and ur team has to be ready for when he comes back out of the ult?
Win or lose, I say it's NOT forcing. It's just a term people use when they are annoyed by the strategy. These are the same people who call people "rats."
Ironically Yoru is actually seeing a lot of play, but you sort of point out why Viper is an issue anyway. Raze & Jett are alternatives to the same role with different playstyles, where as Viper has no alternative.
On the physical gun, purely visual.
Shoot me a message :)
Yeah I know it was just a question, i didn't understand those abilities and how they can be worked. Also since you seem to know him so well, is he vulnerable when ult state? Is OUR player vulnerable when ult state? Like pseudo astra?
Its because low elo tryhards, always have the tracker 24/7 and are always trying to rankup and "improve" therefore when they play something like unranted and notice somebody is way higher than them and is doing badly or destroying them they unleash their low elo frustrations on them.
I'm not surprised this works on valorant if most of the bigger tech companies get bamboozled by this
wdym? i can get the 5th kill... if it's just not taken by teammate. that's literally how an ace works. otherwise, aces would include unnecessary factor with the fact that your teammates lose all gunfights they take on that round
While in Astral Form, Astra hovers and can float inside a oneway without her legs sticking out. However, for this trick one have to use either Omen or Brim buddy, as Astra's own smokes are too big for most places (double box height) to not touch the ground. She can though do such oneways by yellow on Icebox. Pretty hard to pull trick, more like a challange, but much more plausible after lasf buff where Astra got hearing in astral plane.
Literally, even as a straight man I somehow get uncomfortable with the toxic men. 

&#x200B;

On one hand I can't make any boy friends because most men are toxic, the ones who aren't rarely ever talk in chat. (Or just don't have my humour)

&#x200B;

On the other hand I can't make any girl friends because I am a man, and the reputation is ass. 

&#x200B;

So I usually just solo queue at this point LOL
He didn’t say drop the friend, he said drop the duo which makes perfect sense. I’ve done it with a friend of mine because he can be toxic in game and I don’t wanna deal with it. But he’s a good friend besides that.
yeah that’s why i was confused though, i’m horrible since i’m new so i see no reason for them to want to play comp with me
I've been tryna complete same challenges for 2 days now the progress resets after 2 games or everytime I close out the game
Anyone have an extra code?
Rank reset. Went from Asc3 to Gold3. Won half my placement games and played well. Decided not to play ranked any more, just seemed like a waste of time if it reset me that low. I've got a job and a family. Expecting me to play 50+ games to get back to the real rank is a joke.
Note to myself: I'm still waiting for Reaver Vandal to appear in my store :(

I also do scoff at any lower rarity or terrible heroes, but I don't understand how anyone could think outlander means farming
fair enough.

though, people did read and respond, agreeing to my post. so youre wrong there. obviously its not blowing up like the rest of the posts because it is admittedly a smaller issue.
watch fns for getting game sense
Nah.. Im done with BRs and either it’s a BR where headshots are one shots, or it’s not gonna feel like valorant at all because people are not going to try to aim well and just spray
it’s based on your hidden mmr. so if you’re getting a large amount of rr per win (ex. 30-40rr) then you might be eligible to place higher at iron 3-bronze 3. if your rr gains are around 15-20 then i doubt you’ll get placed higher than iron 1, as the game believes that is the rank you deserve

In the moment I'm like "this guy is God, hand him Valorant, best player ever, a cheating smurf purchased bussed toggle hack account." What I really mean is I'm clearing my corners like a plastic bag in the wind and playing like a tard and in the moment I vent my frustration when I know its all my fault and I'm making it easy for the opponent to kill me.

Honestly same about Skye, most annoying part of playing her is that its almost impossible to set yourself up and if your team aren't reacting off your utility you start to question why you bothered to pick her instead of literally any other agent in the game
are u playing in HK server? I find many mainlanders playing there despite them having their own server.
quite a lenghty process which requires alt tab (which allegedly can cause latency issues)

I'd rather prefer a static box with most common ranges like idk 20-30-50 meters with the relative axes gauges for each that reset on a button press.

The process will be simpler - ping place, look at the distance, point skybox, press a button to reset tool's axes and drop the cursor accordingly
Is there a special reason why the highlight color of the word team is "green" for team chat and the highlight color for the word party for the party chat "purple?"

Logon to Valorant i check my K-point accessories daily (even though I know it just gets updated once every week ) and then go for Swifty and if there is  any friend of my rank elo I go  for competition,else after that Swift play I just logout of valorant.
Lol, this reminds me of my first grind to immortal. I would see red carpets and tell myself "the next couldn't be worse" and it actually was.

Just keep grinding. Humans are designed to remember the bad more than the good. It's just how it goes.

my steam account got hacked and all my skins got traded - 2-way-authetification my ass.
told steam and even had proof etc. but it's in steams policy that they aren't gonna get you your skins back after trades.
so now I own a 17 years old steam account and lost all my skins. 
that fucked up support forced me to switch games last year
Yes, but that’s not the point of the boost- I’m not sure how the current version works, but the purpose of the pre-nerf boost was that you could squeeze into Market and catch a rotator off guard- otherwise you have to walk around and up the stairs, and by that time they’ll likely have beaten you into Market.
Yep! When i spot a enemy while my wall is up i stun then inside the wall then slide out

there just is no clear answer to this, just think rationally and treat each match differently. Not only does it depend on in-game roles (Entry, Support, Lurk, OPer etc.) but also on the map, agent and the skill of the individual players.

1/3 of my games are split
Go get some pussy bro, Tf is this shit 🤣
The thing about cypher trips is that you get two of them, and in tons of maps (and in comps where enemies have util to clear on trip like sky, raze roomba, clone) i can just place a second trip near it. 

It’s so stupid that it works. No one expects a cypher to waste two trips in a single choke, and so when they run in they get gunned down. 

Plus tons of my trips are on spots where one won’t really clone.

Example, the door close switch on assent A: you can place a trip next to the switch, and wall back an enemy who tries to hit it close from trees.

I mean I can easily get countered, there is a reason I am hard stuck plat, but I have a few tricks up my sleeves for players who know how to play around my trips, provided I don’t get tagged my the knife and instantly shut down, get outplayed, etc
12% headshot rate? I think we found the issue.
Its alright

Skye, she is quite versatile in her playstyle
That doesn’t help aim tho it just makes you better at shooting bots. Also might as well not strafe atp
Yeah, its weak.. but its not useless. If you won a fight with no hp, I would tell my sage to heal me from a safe location. There's nothing better to do anyway.

Then uninstall bro, what holds you back bruh

You're welcome!
I know that you gotta but really it doesn't work lol
Thought this was Death Stranding for a second
you have way more shit to worry about in ranked. thats why your aim sucks in ranked. call outs, strats, counter strats, abilities, timings, rank anxiety, bad teammates, good enemies, etc. nothing really can prep you for ranked other than just playing ranked if you say your aim is cracked.
I hate haven more than anything and sunset and lotus three worse maps
but my fortnite on DX11 not 12... and its crushing in mid game

Like with anything in life, in order to get really good at something requires a lot of sacrifice and time input. The top radiant streamers have typically invested a lot of time into FPS games and obviously don't get out much to have a social life. Obviously, there are some that deviate from this norm, but plenty are like this. 

You will find this to be the case in many areas. Top programmers, top mathematicians, etc. To get really good in these areas involves a lot of time spent alone grinding. So obviously, their social skills will plummet
reyna’s flash is by far the easiest flash to use for your team. there’s zero chance it blinds your team and forces people to decide to break it and get swung or tuck and lose space.
No they do not if their goal is to shoot them away from the base then they are spot on
Wait this is actually pretty cool
It does work yes. Any sounds will activate it
I think a lot of us wish u were wrong but u are dead on💀
As someone that has played thousands of games of league and has recently started playing valorant, in my experience valorant ranked experience has been way worse. Constant AFKs on both teams, people give up way faster, and just generally toxic. 

A big thing that helps league is the game is 100% playable (and honestly way better) if you full mute and just play with pings. At the same time though, the amount of AFKers and players just giving up in valorant is insane to me.
Girl pro players are in an equal amount as men pro players, once you've factored in the fact that more men play Valorant, and try out.

The thing is, you need to get to Radiant first. . .
OP If you press B starting round, there’s should be another weapon over the Vandal. That’s called Phantom, can oneshot head 15<m (I think) and It’s done for spraying 3-5 control as It reset slower than Vandal. 

There is Odin… There is Guardian. There OP/AWP. Not so much but not so much more there’s in CS2
sorry I had a little stalk but WHAT IS THAT GODLY HEADSHOT PERCENTAGE BAHAHAHHA?? and its not like you’re getting low kill high hs percentage either all of your games are positive in the high teens or twenties and ABOVE 50% HS RATE baffling to see that you’re silver 😭(btw op, imagine someone hype you like this tho, don’t take it as an insult prove them haters wrong)
Maybe in your hands
> cs2 was in response to Valorant releasing and taking most of their community with them

??? 

CS player numbers only increased since Valorant's release, if anything, the release of Valorant helped bring players to CS.

Also, no source on this claim.

> I wouldnt be surprised if val is back on top again

It never was. Valorant has never beaten CS viewership despite insane riot advertising; valorant's biggest matches in terms of viewership are carried by a single team, SEN.
